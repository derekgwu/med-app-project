<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>

<p><b>Infants have a large volume of bilirubin in the bloodstream because they have a 
high red cell mass (haemoglobin) and rapid breakdown of red blood cells in the 
first days of life. A newborn’s immature liver is often unable to rapidly remove 
bilirubin, leading to an excess of unconjugated bilirubin and thus jaundice.</b></p>

<p>Phototherapy should be commenced for neonates with: </p>

<ul>
<li> Any visible jaundice on the day of birth</li>
<li> Jaundice extending below the umbilicus</li>
<li> Bilirubin level indicating need for treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>Phototherapy should also be considered for neonates with jaundice and the following 
complications:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C9_Preterm.html">Prematurity</a></li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C15_Sepsis.html">Sepsis</a></li>
<li> Significant bruising or cephalohaematoma</li>
<li> Maternal-infant blood incompatibility (e.g., ABO or Rhesus incompatibility)</li>
<li> G6PD deficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>Initiation of phototherapy is very rarely required after 14 days of life in term infants and 21 
days in preterm infants.1 Jaundice due to breast feeding may last for a long time (but the 
baby is well). Prolonged jaundice (&gt;14 days) warrants further investigation and discussion 
for possible referral to a tertiary centre. </p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Phototherapy uses blue light transmitted on the patient’s skin within the 
wavelengths of 425 to 475 nm<sup>2</sup>
to break down unconjugated bilirubin to a water-soluble, non-toxic form that can be easily excreted.<sup>3</sup></b></p>

<p>Phototherapy lights may be integrated into units with overhead <b>(2.1),</b> over- and underbody <b>(2.2), </b>or flexible blanket lights.<b> (2.3) </b>Most phototherapy units can be used in tandem 
with other devices (e.g., radiant warmers, incubators, and oxygen therapy). This clinical 
module will provide guidelines for the use of overhead phototherapy lights.</p>

<p>Phototherapy lights are most effective when providing blue light within 425 to 475 nm via 
LEDs.</p>

<p>Other types of bulbs providing blue light within 425 to 475 nm (e.g., halogen or 
fluorescent) are less effective for treating jaundice, have a shorter lifetime, and are not as 
sustainable for long term use. Halogen and fluorescent bulbs are less efficient than LEDs 
and may also be a source of heat, introducing a potential risk for hyperthermia.<sup>4,5</sup> Other 
types of phototherapy are also used, but are typically not recommended:</p>

<ul>
<li><b> UV lights:</b> not recommended for neonatal therapy due to increased melanoma risk 
associated with childhood UV exposure.</li>
<li> <b>Natural sunlight:</b> traditionally used in lieu of phototherapy devices; natural sunlight is not 
ideal due to increased challenges with temperature control of the patient and UV radiation 
risks.</li>
<li> <b>Filtered sunlight: </b>there is emerging evidence that devices that filter sunlight, while 
requiring close monitoring in order to prevent temperature instability, can be used in 
babies > 2.2kg in tropical climates to treat neonatal jaundice.<sup>6–9</sup></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Kramer">Need for Phototherapy</h3>
<p>There are different methods to determine need for phototherapy, all of which rely on 
measuring or estimating the bilirubin levels in the blood. Bilirubin levels can be measured 
in all babies using a blood test and transcutaneous devices<sup>10,11</sup> or estimated through 
visual assessment with reference to the Kramer’s scale. <b>(2.4)</b></p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin136.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin136.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>In the absence of timely availability of serum bilirubin measurements, which are the gold 
standard, phototherapy should be started for any visible jaundice on day one of life (make 
sure to press nose, look in mouth and check conjunctiva), or at a Kramer's level of 3 for 
jaundice on day 2 of life and later (when jaundice is visible below the umbilicus). See 
<b>Alert 2.1</b> for detailed information about the Kramer's scale. Assessment should be made 
in natural or white light to ensure results are accurate. Both transcutaneous bilirubin<sup>12</sup> and 
the Kramer's scale are less precise in determining serum levels after phototherapy has 
begun. Some units may plot bilirubin levels using nomograms as well. Ensure a reference 
is used which is consistent with unit policy.</p>

<p >If serum bilirubin or transcutaneous bilirubin </a>is available,<b> Table 2.1</b> provides reference 
levels for when to start phototherapy or consider an exchange transfusion.<sup>13,14</sup></p>

<p>Measurement of serum bilirubin is the best assessment of neonatal 
jaundice. However, when timely serum bilirubin measurements are 
unavailable, <a href="#Kramer">Kramer's</a>
is the only studied physical exam proxy for 
estimating serum bilirubin levels in neonates.</p>


<p>The Kramer's scale has shown observer to observer variance, especially 
at high bilirubin levels.<sup>15-17</sup> However, when ruling out jaundice of bilirubin 
levels &gt;12 mg/dL (215 mmol/L), studies have shown that the Kramer's 
scale can be used pre-phototherapy in term infants if limited to zones 
1,2.<sup>16,17</sup></p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Usual optimal spectral irradiance for conventional phototherapy is 25-30µW/cm<sup>2</sup> as 
measured by a phototherapy light meter. Higher optimal spectral irradiances of 30-35 
µW/cm<sup>2</sup> may be used for intensive phototherapy for at risk infants.<sup>18</sup> Most jaundiced 
patients require treatment for 24 to 48 hours, and typically do not require treatment for 
any longer than 7 days. If jaundice persists, further investigation into the cause of the 
jaundice should be conducted.</p>

commencement, care whilst on the device & removal of the patient from the device.</b></p>

<h3 id="setting" div style="background-color:lightblue">SETTING UP FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>

<li> Collect: </li>

<ul>
<li> Phototherapy device</li>
<li> Power cable</li>
<li> Phototherapy light meter (if available)</li>
</ul>

<li> Plug in phototherapy device. Turn on and check for <b>blue light </b>from the overhead 
light elements. NOTE: Some phototherapy lights may have white examination 
lights. In most models, if light emitting from this type of device is white, 
it is <b>not 
therapeutic.</b></li>
<li> Turn on light meter if available. Place light meter on the mattress where the patient 
needing phototherapy will be located. <b>(3.1)</b></li>

<br>


<li> The phototherapy unit is typically set at a point where the overhead lights are 
approximately 20 - 30 cm above a typical cot. Check that irradiance provided at 
this height is within therapeutic ranges and adjust the height if necessary. <b>(3.2)</b></li>

<ul>
<li> If irradiance is too low, lower the height of the phototherapy light until therapeutic 
ranges are reached without obstructing care.</li>
<li>If irradiance is too high, raise the height of the phototherapy light until therapeutic 
ranges are reached.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Light should cover the entire surface on which the patient will be treated.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">PREPARING A PATIENT</h3>

<li> Always explain the purpose, risks and benefits of a procedure to guardians 
BEFORE performing the procedure.</li>
<li> Follow handwashing protocol.</li>
<li> Collect:</li>

<ul>
<li> Eye mask or gauze and tape</li>
</ul>


<li> Remove all clothes. The diaper should cover the minimum necessary to keep the 
baby clean. </li>
<li> Place eye mask so that it fully covers the patient’s eyes. <b>(3.3)</b> The mask should be 
tight enough that it will remain in place should the patient be active, but not so tight 
that it is visibly uncomfortable or cutting into the patient’s skin. If a ready-made eye 
mask is not available, use gauze to cover the eyes and tape to secure in place.

<ol>
<li> Babies should receive as continuous phototherapy treatment as possible.</li>
<li> Monitor according to clinical condition, or in accordance to local policy:</li>

<ul>
<li><b> Vital signs: </b>including respiratory rate, heart rate, peripheral blood oxygen
saturation, blood sugar and temperature, or any additional danger signs.</li>

<li><b> Skin rotation:</b> the baby should be turned 4 hourly to expose more skin to 
phototherapy lights.</li>

<li><b> Daily bilirubin levels:</b> at least 4 hourly if rising rapidly and if available. Document 
all bilirubin results with date and time. If serum bilirubin measurement is not 
available, provide daily reference to the level observed on the Kramer scale.</li>

<li><b> Signs of dehydration: </b>jaundiced babies must be well hydrated; extra breastfeeds 
encourage bowel motions and promote bilirubin excretion. Check that urine is 
being passed frequently.</li>

<li> <b>Daily weight</b></li>

</ul>


<li> At every monitoring point (4 hourly), check that:</li>
<ul>
<li> The eye mask fully covers the patient’s eyes and is still secure. <b>(Alert 3.1)</b></li>
<li> The baby is feeding well and weight is not decreasing. If the baby is not feeding 
well, consider providing additional expressed breast milk via a nasogastric tube 
(NGT) or cup, or if very ill an IV fluid therapy containing dextrose.</li>
<li> There are no abnormal movements.</li>
<li> Any underlying conditions are being treated.</li>
<li> Serum bilirubin levels or jaundice areas are not increasing.<b> Blue lights must be 
switched off to accurately assess visible jaundice.</b> Some phototherapy lights 
may have white examination lights that can be used to better assess the patient.</li>
</ul>

<li> If serum bilirubin levels or jaundice areas are increasing:</li>

<ul>
<li> Check the irradiance at the patient’s bed-level using a lightmeter. 
If the irradiance 
is lower than recommended,<b> increase the irradiance </b>provided by changing the 
machine settings to a higher level (e.g., brilliance mode) if available, or lowering 
the height of the phototherapy lights.</li>
<li> Ensure maximum skin exposed to light and continue regular feeds. Consider 
starting IV fluids if bilirubin levels or jaundice is rapidly increasing.</li>

<tr>
<td>
<p>In the absence of timely serum bilirubin measurement, there is no 
evidence-based method for determining when to remove a patient from 
phototherapy. WHO Europe guideline suggests a “minimum of 12 hours 
phototherapy” which is too short for most preterm infants or deeply 
jaundiced term infants. WHO Pocket Book for Children does not provide 
guidance on how to stop phototherapy in the absence of utilising serum 
bilirubin.<sup>1,19,20</sup></p>

<p>Thus, based on expert opinion, although there are no studies addressing 
the accuracy of the Kramer's scale after starting phototherapy, it was 
determined best to give some physical exam guidance based on the 
Kramer's scale for when to discontinue phototherapy. Additionally, in the 
absence of bilirubin levels, cleared conjunctiva are often used as 
indicating that jaundice has resolved sufficiently to stop treatment. This 
has not been formally evaluated.</p>

<p>Alternately, if choosing to discontinue phototherapy using length of 
therapy, based on expert opinion we would recommend a minimum of 24 
hours of phototherapy for term infants and longer for preterm infants.</p></td>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospital-acquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not 
disinfected or re-processed promptly or adequately between patients, they may 
pose a significant infection risk.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or alcohol before and after placing a patient 
under phototherapy or handling any materials that will be used on a patient (e.g., 
eye covers).</li>

<li>Ensure that all patient-related equipment (including eye coverings) are new or 
have been cleaned thoroughly before use. Any patient-related materials, including 
cot linen, must be cleaned before they are placed on a patient under a 
phototherapy device.</li>

<li> All patient-related equipment should be stored in a clean, dry location. Any cables 
should be loosely wrapped and secured, preventing sharp bends or kinks, which 
will decrease the lifetime of the cables. Do not pinch or bend the cables.

<li> Only one baby should be under each phototherapy unit. Sharing of a phototherapy</li> 
light in one cot poses a high risk for infection transmission between patients. Some 
phototherapy units may be able to provide therapeutic light to multiple patients in 
several cots at once; though this inevitably means that the cots are close to each 
other and increases the likelihood of infection transmission. The light should 
always be tested for efficacy using a light meter near the location in which the 
patient will be placed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Turn off phototherapy light and unplug. Disinfect handle of phototherapy light meter 
and LCD controls using alcohol. <b>(4.1)</b></li>

<li> Housing of the phototherapy unit (including the casing on the LEDs or lightbulbs) 
should be cleaned thoroughly according to ward guidelines for disinfecting 
surfaces.</li>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ol>
<li><b> Dehydration:</b> neonatal patients under phototherapy with lights other than LEDs may 
require more fluid than maintenance volumes. It is important to ensure the patient is 
feeding well and to monitor for signs of dehydration (not passing urine, weight loss >= 5%, 
prolonged skin turgor). Additional feeds or intravenous fluids may be required. 
Dehydration may be worsened by diarrhoea which is a recognised complication of 
jaundice.<sup>23</sup></lil>

<li><b> Hypothermia: </b>temperature should be carefully monitored as patients are nearly naked 
under phototherapy. Phototherapy devices <b></b>are not intended as heating devices. LED 
bulbs used in most modern devices are very efficient so generate minimal heat; a warming 
device may be required to avoid hypothermia.</li>

<li><b> Retinal damage: </b>consistent exposure of the eyes to strong light has been shown to cause 
retinal damage in adults. Although this has not been tested in neonates, care should be 
taken to keep the eyes covered at all times during treatment. <b>(5.1)</b></li>

<li><b> Eye infections: </b>check for redness, swelling or discharge. The skin under the eye pads 
should be cleaned daily with warm sterile water to prevent infection.</li>

<li><b> Bronze baby syndrome:</b> some babies develop a greyish colour to their skin (difficult to 
see in pigmented babies), urine, and plasma during phototherapy. This is attributed to 
increased accumulation of bilirubin photoisomers, degradation products, or copper-
porphyrin conjugates. The true cause remains uncertain. It is self-limiting, resolves after
phototherapy is stopped, and has no long-term sequelae.<sup>24–26</sup></li>

<br>
<a href="../assets/images/coin146.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin146.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<br>

<li id="kern"><b> Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (Kernicterus)</b>extremely high levels of bilirubin can 
cross the blood brain barrier causing kernicterus. This may manifest as hypertonia and 
seizures. If the jaundice is not promptly and appropriately treated with adequate 
phototherapy light, permanent brain damage may occur e.g., development of deafness, 
choreoathetoid movements, and cerebral palsy. In addition to phototherapy, exchange 
transfusions are required for serious jaundice.<sup>23</sup></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ol>
<li><b> Inadequate light: </b>after a set period of use (about 20,000 – 50,000 hours, depending on 
manufacturer recommendations), phototherapy devices may lose their ability to provide 
therapeutic light. It is important to test the capacity of the phototherapy regularly to ensure 
that the phototherapy light is still providing a therapeutic range (25 – 35 µW/cm<sup>2</sup>
).</li>
