<p><b>Oxygen sources may be used to provide supplemental oxygen directly to patients, 
shared between patients by using a  <a class="seealso" href="E5_Oxygen splitter.html">flow splitter</a> or used with other treatment 
devices such as <a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html">continuous positive airway pressure devices.</a></b></p>

<p>Supplemental oxygen is indicated for sick children, especially those with hypoxia. Hypoxia 
is defined as an oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt; 90%.

<p>Whilst nearly all sick infants may benefit from oxygen therapy, any concentration of 
oxygen administered without appropriate monitoring of 
<a class="seealso" href="E2_Pulse oximeter.html">peripheral blood oxygen saturation</a>
 can cause harm.<sup>1</sup> Carefully select between those that would benefit from 
oxygen delivered directly to a patient (e.g., via nasal prongs) and those that would benefit 
from supplemental oxygen delivered with pressure via <a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html">CPAP</a>. Monitor carefully and 
discontinue oxygen as soon as it becomes unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Hypoxia contributes to both morbidity and mortality. Oxygen therapy may be used 
to improve body tissue oxygenation, measured by SpO<sub>2</sub> levels and also to provide 
symptomatic relief.</b></p>

<p>Oxygen therapy may be delivered using <a class="seealso" href="E3_Oxygen concentrator.html">oxygen concentrators</a>
, <a class="seealso" href="E5_Oxygen splitter.html">oxygen flow splitters</a>, 
walled oxygen, and <a class="seealso" href="E4_Oxygen cylinder.html">oxygen cylinders</a>. Oxygen flow rates vary based on intended use and 
mode of delivery: </p>

<ul>
<li> Resuscitation with bag and mask ventilation: 10 L/min<sup>1</sup>
<b>(Alert 2.1)</b></li>
<li> Flowmeter stand (Splitter): 1 – 2 L/min per oxygen port</li>
<li> Prongs: up to 2 L/min</li>
<li> Mask: from 3 L/min to 10 L/min</li>
<li> CPAP: from 1 L/min to 6 L/min</li>
</ul>

<td>American Academy of Pediatrics resuscitation recommendations are 10
L/min of air, 21% Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) for term babies and
30% FiO 2 for preterm babies.<sup>1</sup> FiO2 should then be titrated with a blender
based on minutes of life and target SpO2 levels, which may not reach
85-95% until after 5-10 minutes of life. All sick newborns who are not
rapidly improving will need supplementary oxygen at increased FiO2. In
settings where blenders are not available FiO2 will not be able to be as
tightly controlled when oxygen is required during resuscitation.

<p>Neonatal patients should reach SpO<sub>2</sub> levels of 90 – 95%<b> (Alert 2.1)</b> by 15 minutes after 
birth. <b>(Alert 2.2)</b> If oxygen is needed it is recommended to give between 0.5-1 L/min.<sup>2</sup>
Whilst on oxygen, regular monitoring should be conducted using a pulse oximeter to 
ensure that this saturation range is maintained for the duration of treatment. Ideally, 
patients suffering from severe respiratory distress should have continuous pulse oximetry 
monitoring throughout care.<sup>2</sup></p>

<li>According to the <u>Textbook of Neonatal Resuscitation (NRP), 7th </u>
Ed., “After birth, the oxygen saturation gradually increases above 
90%. However, even healthy term newborns may take 10 minutes 
or longer to reach this saturation” (p.77).<sup>1</sup></li>
<li> Target peripheral oxygen concentrations (SpO2) for newborns vary 
depending on age and clinical condition. However, most authorities 
agree that saturations between 90-95% minimises the 
complications associated with both low and high oxygen levels 
including death, neurodevelopmental impairment and Retinopathy 
of Prematurity.<sup>3-6</sup></li></ol>

<h2 id="Management">Management</h2>

<p><b>Management of oxygen therapy covers how to use the device in a variety of 
settings, including patient preparation & commencement, care whilst on oxygen 
therapy & removal of the patient from the therapy. See the modules on 
<a class="seealso" href="E3_Oxygen concentrator.html">oxygen concentrators</a>
, <a class="seealso" href="E4_Oxygen cylinder.html">oxygen cylinders</a> and <a class="seealso" href="E5_Oxygen splitter.html">oxygen flow splitters</a>, 
for device specific recommendations.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">PREPARING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Assess the condition of the baby. Ensure all clinical management measures are 
taken of which oxygen delivery is only one. Check the ABC and assess:</li>

<ul>
<li><b> Airway:</b> suction if secretions are present</li>
<li><b> Breathing:</b></li>
<ul>
<li> Respiratory rate: is it >60b/min</li>
<li> SpO<sup>2</sup>: peripheral blood oxygen saturation level, is it <90%</li>
<li> Work of breathing: e.g., grunting, fast breathing, chest indrawing</li>
</li> Chest auscultation</li></ul>
<li> <b>Circulation:</b></li>
<ul>
<li> <b>Perfusion:</b> cool limbs and prolonged capillary refill time (>3 sec)</li>
<li> Heart sounds </li></ul>
<li> Seizures </li>
<li> Temperature</li>
</ul>

<li> If CPAP is available assess whether the patient would benefit more from bubble 
CPAP than from oxygen alone. If so, prepare the patient for <a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html">bubble CPAP</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">STARTING A PATIENT</h3>
<ol>
<li> Collect:</li>
<ul>
<li> Appropriately sized nasal prongs (should fit loosely in the nostrils)</li>
<li> Tape</li>
<li> Cotton wool</li>
</ul>

<li> Check that the end of the prong tubing is secured to the oxygen port on the 
concentrator, flow has been set and that oxygen is coming out of the nasal prongs.</li>

<li> Insert the nasal prongs and secure in place on both cheeks with tape. Adjust loop 
adjustment slider to hold nasal prongs looped above the ears in place securely. 
Protect the sides of the nose and cheek where the tubing could rub and injure the 
skin.<b> (3.1)</b></li>

<li> Consider labelling nasal prongs to more easily determine which patients are being 
treated with which oxygen ports. This will make it easier for future staff to adjust 
oxygen levels & prevent incorrect changes from being made to the patient’s 
treatment due to port misidentification. <b>(3.2)</b></li></ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">CARING FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> After starting on oxygen, monitor saturations using continuous 
<a class="seealso" href="E2_Pulse oximeter.html">pulse oximetry</a>. 
Titrate oxygen up and down until normal saturation limits (SpO<sub>2</sub> 90 – 95)<sup>3–6</sup> are 
reached. If patient requires more than 2 L/min of oxygen, nasal prongs should be 
changed to either CPAP or facemask <b>(3.7)</b> oxygen depending on the underlying 
clinical condition. <b>(Alert 3.2)</b></li>
<li> Monitor according to clinical condition, or in accordance to local policy:</li>
<ul>
<li> Vital signs, including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure
and temperature</li>
<li> Work of breathing (see above)</li>
<li> Nostril patency</li>
</ul>
<li> Administer nasal saline drops to prevent mucosal drying, every four hours or more 
frequently depending on need.</li>

<td><p>Guidance  on when to administer low flow oxygen versus bCPAP in
neonates is a complex decision which should be made on an individualised 
basis for each country implementing comprehensive neonatal units with
bCPAP. It is a decision which must account for potential harms, benefits,
staff training, staff to patient ratio, infrastructure and allocation of care
within the health system.</p>
<p>NEST is aimed at implementing comprehensive neonatal care units with 
bCPAP in low resource settings in order to reduce facility-based mortality
by 50% while also minimising morbidity. In light of potential harms
associated with hyperoxia, high burden of premature and low birthweight
infants in these types of units, and high patient to nurse ratios, 2L/min on
nasal cannula was felt to be a reasonable level at which to consider moving
a patient to bCPAP. This decision depends also on their clinical condition
and is consistent with WHO recommendations for “standard flow rates” for
neonates. At 2L/min from an oxygen cylinder, a 2kg infant may be receiving
close to 100% FiO2<sup>7</sup> and smaller infants may additionally be receiving
some amount of positive pressure<sup>2,7-9</sup> which could be better regulated by
CPAP than by a low flow oxygen device.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">REMOVING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Once patients can maintain normal oxygen saturations and are clinically stable, 
the oxygen flow rate should be reduced based on clinical response:</li>
<ul>

<li> Reduce oxygen flow by 0.25 L/min, rechecking saturations and clinical condition
after 15 minutes.</li>
<li> If saturations and clinical condition remain stable, continue reducing oxygen flow
by increments of 0.25 L/min, rechecking saturations 15 minutes after each
reduction and then every 4 hours or as clinically indicated.</li>
<li> If saturations drop below 90% or the patient clinically deteriorates, increase the
oxygen until normal saturations are obtained and the patient clinically improves.</li>
</ul>

<li> Once saturations are consistently above 90 - 95% at 0.25 L/min and the patient is 
clinically stable, remove patient from oxygen by gently removing the tape and 
taking the prongs out of the patient’s nostrils. Recheck the saturations after 15 
minutes:</li>

<ul>
<li> If saturations have dropped or there is a clinical deterioration, recommence
oxygen.</li>
<li> If saturations and clinical condition are stable, remove patient from oxygen.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospital-acquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not disinfected or reprocessed promptly or adequately between patients, they may pose a significant infection risk.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or alcohol before and after placing a patient on 
oxygen or handling any tubing that will be used on a patient.</li>
<li> Ensure that all patient-related tubing and consumables (including prongs and 
humidifier bottles) are new or have been cleaned thoroughly before use. Any 
patient-related tubing must be cleaned before it is used to place another patient on 
oxygen. The <a href="#Reprocessing">Reprocessing Respiratory Tubing Algorithm</a> details reprocessing 
tubing for reuse.</li>
<li> Tubing should be hung to dry after disinfection and should not touch the floor or 
other unsanitary surfaces whilst drying. <b>(4.2)</b> It should be clearly labelled as having 
been cleaned.</li>
<li> All patient-related cleaned and new consumables should be stored in a clean, dry 
location. Tubing should be stored in loose rolls, preventing sharp bends or kinks 
which will decrease the lifetime of the tubing.</li>
</ol>
<a href="../assets/images/coin74.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin74.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Remove end of prong tubing from oxygen port. If reusing, immediately begin 
hospital protocol for disinfection of tubing. Delay in initiating cleaning of reused 
medical devices can lead to the need for more intensive cleaning procedures to 
remove pathogens. If not reusing, discard appropriately. <b>(Alert 4.1)</b></li>
<li> If using a humidifier in the oxygen circuit, change water after each patient or daily, 
if being used on the same patient.<sup>2</sup></li>

<tr>
<td>Respiratory circuits and humidifiers associated with oxygen delivery are 
generally intended as single use devices. However, in areas with limited

When re-processing single use devices it is extremely important that the
cleaning process is not delayed following completion of use. There
should be a detailed standard of practice as well as oversight processes 
for ensuring timely and high-quality re-processing. If equipment is not
re-processed promptly or adequately between patients, it poses a
significant infection risk. Please refer to the <u>Reference Manual for Health

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ol>
<li> <b>Hypoxia:</b> if the nasal prongs become dislodged or blocked, the oxygen concentrator
malfunctions or is turned off there is a risk that the baby will not receive enough oxygen.
Hypoxia can cause:</li>

<ul>
<li> Damage to the brain (e.g. periventricular leukomalacia – damage to the white
matter of the brain)</li>
<li> Multi-organ failure</li>
<li> Death</li>
</ul>
<br/>Reference <b><a href="#safe">Alert 2.2</a></b> for a full discussion of oxygen saturation level targets and 
recommendations.

<li> <b>Hyperoxia: </b>if the peripheral blood oxygen saturations (SpO<sub>2</sub>) are not monitored
appropriately or the flow rate is inadvertently changed there is a risk that the baby will
receive too much oxygen. Whilst oxygen can be lifesaving, peripheral blood oxygen
saturations (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% on oxygen therapy can cause morbidities in premature
babies, including:</li>

<ul>
<li> Retinopathy of prematurity: in premature babies, high blood oxygen levels can
result in development of abnormal blood vessels on the retina, causing potential
visual impairment or even blindness.</li>
<li> Chronic lung disease: prolonged use (although sometimes unavoidable) of oxygen
in premature babies causes lung fibrosis through inflammatory processes.</li>
</ul>

<li> <b>Nasal blockage: </b>the nasal prongs and nostrils can become blocked with mucus which
may result in increased respiratory distress and hypoxia.</li>
<li> <b>Necrotic septum: </b>incorrectly sized or applied nasal prongs may result in pressure on the
nasal septum with resultant necrosis (tissue breakdown). Nasal septum should be
checked twice daily.</li>
<li><b>Nasal prongs:</b> prongs may become displaced, critically affecting the amount of oxygen
received by the patient. All health workers, including the parents/guardians involved in the
infant’s care should be aware of and watch out for this.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<p><b>Inadequate oxygen concentrations: </b>all forms of delivered oxygen therapy are subject to issues 
with oxygen concentration. This may result in inadequate levels of oxygen to treat respiratory 
distress directly or through another device (e.g., CPAP).</p>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Power source, location and preventive maintenance will vary by oxygen therapy 
type. See the modules on
