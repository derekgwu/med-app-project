<p>This session covers resuscitation of a newborn (who has just been delivered). <br/>

See <a class="seealso" href="C4_ResuscInfant.html">resuscitation</a> of the infant for older infants




<h2>Why is care at birth important?</h2>

<p>This is the critical period of transition from intra-utero life to extra-utero independent existence.<br>
Effective care at birth is needed to anticipate problems with this transition and to provide support to ensure stabilization. Most babies born with apnoea at birth will start to breathe themselves within 60 – 90 seconds if they have a clear airway.</p>

<h2 id="help">Which babies require resuscitation?</h2>

<p>Approximately 10% of newborns require some assistance to begin breathing at birth; very few, only about <b>1% need more than basic resuscitation to survive.</b></p>

<h2 id="routine"style="color:blue;">High Risk Deliveries</h2>

<p>These are deliveries where it is more likely that resuscitation will be required. These include deliveries to mothers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who are sick</li>
<li>Who had a previous foetal or neonatal death</li>
<li>With pre-eclampsia or eclampsia</li>
<li>With multiple pregnancies</li>
<li>Who are delivering preterm</li>
</ul>

<p>The delivery may progress in a way that makes it more likely that the infant will require resuscitation; such deliveries include those where there is:</p>

<ul>
<li>An abnormal presentation as it may take some time for the delivery</li>
<li>A prolonged second stage</li>
<li>A prolapsed cord</li>
<li>A prolonged rupture of the membranes</li>
<li>Meconium staining of the liquor</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prep"style="color:blue;"> Preparation for a delivery</h2>
<p>For many infants, resuscitation cannot be anticipated before delivery. Therefore: be prepared for resuscitation at <u>every</u> delivery.</p>


<h3>Temperature</h3>

<p>The recommended temperature for the delivery room is 25°C.To prevent drafts of air, shut all
windows and switch off air conditioning and fans before the birth. If a resuscitaire is available, it
should be warmed up 30 minutes before the delivery. You should have at least two pre-warmed
absorbent towels or cloths available at delivery, one to dry the baby and one to wrap the baby.</p>

<h3>Personnel</h3>

<p>Nurse/midwife should identify a helper and explain roles: the helper may be a qualified nursing
staff, an untrained hospital staff, or relative of the mother. You should assign and explain the role
to the helper according to his/her skill. Their role may be to help you dry and stimulate the infant
or to feel the cord for the heart rate.
</p>

<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>

<p>Before birth check that all equipment and supplies are available, are clean and in good working
condition. Identify which personnel will help if resuscitation is required. Equipment should be in
an area in the delivery room for facilitating immediate care of the newborn. This area is essential
for all health facilities where deliveries take place.

<h3>Test the equipment required to provide newborn resuscitation</h3>

<p>Once the equipment has been selected and assembled, check the bag and mask to be sure they
function properly. Bags that have cracks or tears, valves that stick or leak, or masks that are
cracked or deflated must not be used. The equipment should be checked before each delivery.
</p>
<p>The operator should check it again as they wait to receive the baby.</p>

<h2 id="deli" style="color:blue;">Baby is Delivered</h2>

<p>Most newborns require only simple supportive care at and after delivery. Deliver the baby on to
mother’s abdomen as in the Helping Babies Breathe protocol, note the time of birth. Wait for one
minute before clamping the pulsating umbilical cord, as the baby will get an additional amount of
blood during this time which has proven health benefits. In term babies, there is increase in iron
reserves up to six months but there is a risk of <a class="seealso" href="C13_Jaundice.html">jaundice</a> that requires phototherapy. In preterm
babies, there is a risk of bleeding in the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage), less risk of
necrotizing enterocolitis (a severe infection in the bowels) and fewer babies need transfusion for
anaemia. </p>

<p>The baby is placed on the first dry warm cloth, which can be used to dry most of the fluid. This
cloth should then be removed, and the second cloth should be used for wrapping the baby.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin10.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin10.png" max-width="100%"/></a>
 
 <p><b>TWO clothes </b>are required – one to dry and a fresh one to wrap.
</p>

<p>After birth the baby remains wet with amniotic fluid, which if not dried immediately, can lead to heat loss. This heat loss may result in rapid decrease in infant’s body temperature. <br>
Whilst drying the baby, the breathing, tone, and activity of the baby should be assessed. Drying
itself often provides sufficient stimulation for breathing to start.</p>

<p><b>What other safe and appropriate methods of providing additional stimulation may
be included to help a baby breathe?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Gentle rubbing the newborn’s back, trunk, or extremities with the towel.</li>
<li>Rubbing the hands or feet between your fingers with gentle pressure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Resusc" style="color:blue;">Steps to Follow During Resuscitation</h2>
<b>Note</b>: If the baby requires resuscitation <u>provide warmth with a 
<a class="seealso" href="E8_Radiant Warmer.html">radiant warmer</a> or in a warming
cot</u>.

<p><b>Position yourself at the bedside.</b></p>

<p>You will need to position yourself at the baby’s head to use a resuscitation device effectively. 
This position leaves the baby’s chest and abdomen unobstructed for visual monitoring and for chest compressions should this become necessary.</p>

<h2>A. Ensure that the <u <b id="airway">Airway</u> is open and clear.</h2>
<p><b>Open the airway by slightly extending the neck.</b></p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin14.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin14.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<a href="../assets/images/coin14aa.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin14aa.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>The baby should be positioned on the back, with the neck slightly extended in the “neutral” position.
The neutral position while supine is the best position for assisted ventilation with a mask. Care should
be taken to prevent hyperextension or flexion of the neck, since either may restrict air entry.</p>

<p>Clear airway (as necessary).</p>

 <figcaption><small>Correct head position to open up airway for bag ventilation. <br/>Do not hyperextend the neck.</figcaption>
</small></figure>

<p>If the baby has a large occiput (back of head) resulting
from moulding, oedema, or prematurity, you may place a
rolled cloth to help the position.</p>


<h3>How do you clear the airway if no meconium is present?</h3>

<p>Secretions may be removed from the airway by wiping the nose and mouth with a towel, or by
suctioning with a penguin sucker or suction catheter. If the newborn has copious secretions
coming from the mouth, turn the head to the side. This will allow secretions to collect in the cheek
where they can be removed more easily. Use a <a href="#penguin">Penguin</a> sucker or a suction catheter attached to
mechanical suction to remove any fluid that appears to be blocking the airway.</p>

<p>After delivery, the appropriate method for clearing the airway further will depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>The presence of meconium on the baby’s skin or in the airway.</li>
<li>The baby’s level of activity.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Suction the Mouth and Nose (M before N) using <b id="penguin">Penguin</b> suction device.</b></p>

<h3>What to do if meconium is present</h3>

<p>If the baby born with meconium-stained fluid has a normal respiratory effort, normal muscle tone,
and a heart rate greater than 100 bpm, simply clear secretions if necessary; there is no nned for suction.</p>

<p>If the baby is born through meconium stained amniotic fluid and has depressed respirations, has
depressed muscle tone, and/or has a heart rate below 100 bpm, suctioning of the mouth and nose
soon after delivery is indicated.</p>

<h3>What do you do after the initial steps?</h3>

<p>Evaluate the baby in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Respiration;</b> there should be good chest movements, and the rate and depth of
respirations should increase after a few seconds of stimulation. Most babies establish breathing by 90 seconds with a good heart rate.</li><p>
<li><b>Heart rate;</b> the heart rate should be more than 100 bpm.</li></p></ul>

<a href="../assets/images/coin18.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin18.png" max-width="100%"/></a>

<p>The easiest and quickest method to determine the heart rate is to feel for the pulse at the base
of the umbilical cord or you can listen over the heart using a stethoscope.<br>
A good way to indicate to your colleague the rate of the heartbeat is to tap it out with your
finger.<br>
Count the heart rate for 6 seconds and multiply by 10 to calculate the heart rate</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Colour;</b> the baby should have pink lips and trunk. There should be no central cyanosis once
the baby has good respiration and heartbeat. NOTE: peripheral cyanosis can persist for a few
hours</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="breathing">B - Positive Pressure Ventilation with bag and mask</h2>

<p>Indications for bag and mask ventilation are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Baby is not breathing or is gasping,</li>
<li>Heart rate is less than <b>100 bpm</b>, even with spontaneous breathing</li>
<li>Persistent central cyanosis despite oxygen</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ventilation is the single most important and most effective step in cardiopulmonary
resuscitation of the compromised newly born baby.</b><br>
Priority should be given to providing adequate ventilation rather than to chest compressions.</p>

<p><b>Appropriately sized masks</b></p>

<p>A variety of mask sizes, appropriate for babies of different sizes, should be available at every
delivery, since it may be difficult to determine the appropriate size before birth. For the mask to
be of the correct size, the rim will cover the tip of the chin, the mouth, and the nose but not the
eyes.<br>
<ul>
<li>Too large- will not seal well and may cause eye damage.</li>	
<li>Too small- will not cover the mouth and nose and may occlude the nose.</li>	
</ul>
<p><b>Shape of face masks</b></p>

<p>Masks come in two shapes: round and anatomically shaped. Anatomically shaped masks are
shaped to fit the contours of the face. They are made to be placed on the face with the most
pointed part of the mask fitting over the nose.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin19.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin19.png" max-width="100%"/></a>

<h3>How do you position the bag and mask on the face?</h3>

<p>Place the mask on the face so that it covers the nose and mouth, and the tip of the chin rests within the rim of the mask. </p>
<p>The mask usually is held on the face with the thumb, index, and/or middle finger encircling much of the rim of the mask, while the ring and fifth fingers lift the chin forward to maintain a patent airway.</p>

<h3>Safety Features</h3>

<p>To minimize complications resulting from high ventilation pressures, bags have certain safety 
features to prevent or guard against inadvertent use of high pressures. They have a pressure-release 
valve <b>(commonly called pop-off valve)</b>, which generally is set by the manufacturer at 30 to 40 cm H2O. If a peak inspiratory pressure greater than 30 to 40 cm H2O is generated, the valve opens, limiting the pressure that is transmitted to the newborn.</p>

<h3>Use of self-Inflating Bag to Ventilate Newborns</h3>

<p>The self-inflating bag, as its name implies, inflates automatically, it remains inflated at all times, unless
being squeezed. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) also called peak inflation pressure is controlled by
how hard the bag is squeezed.</p>

<figure>

 <figcaption><small>The Self-Inflating Bag <br/>

but ONLY after other manoeuvres have been tried.</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

<h3>How to assess the effectiveness of positive-pressure ventilation.</h3>

<p>The best indicator that the mask is sealed and the lungs are being adequately inflated is the chest
movements with each breath. Most newborns respond to effective ventilation with a rising heart
rate that exceeds 100 beats per minute, improvement in colour and, finally, spontaneous
respiratory effort. Oxygen saturation should rise with breathing until about 10 minutes.</p>

<p><b>What ventilation rate should you provide during bag and mask?</b></p>

<p>During the initial stages of neonatal resuscitation, breaths should be delivered at a rate of 40 to 60
breaths per minute, or slightly less than once a second.</p>

<p><b>What concentration of oxygen should be used when giving positive-pressure
ventilation during resuscitation?</b></p>

<p>Resuscitation of <u>term</u> newborns with <b>room air</b> is just as successful as resuscitation with 100% oxygen. Ventilation of the lungs is the single most important and most effective step, regardless of the concentration of oxygen being used. </p>
<p>During ventilation of preterm babies born at or before 32 weeks of gestation, it is recommended to start oxygen therapy with 30% oxygen. If blended oxygen is not available then it is better to use air rather than with 100% oxygen (<a class="seealso" href="bibl.html">5</a>).</p>

<p>If you have additional help, then request that they attach a pulse oximeter. However it is important
to note the time of expected oxygen saturations. With good bag and mask the oxygen saturations
should slowly improve in accordance with the sequence below:
<ul>
	<li>1 minute – 60 to 65 percent</li>
<li>2 minutes – 65 to 70 percent</li>
<li>3 minutes – 70 to 75 percent</li>
<li>4 minutes – 75 to 80 percent</li>
<li>5 minutes – 80 to 85 percent</li>
<li>10 minutes – 85 to 95 percent</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>How do you know if the baby is improving and that you can stop positive pressure ventilation?</h3>

<p>Improvement is indicated by the following 4 signs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing heart rate</li>
<li>Improving colour</li>
<li>Spontaneous breathing</li>
<li>Improving muscle tone</li>
</ul>

<h3>What do you do if the heart rate, colour, and muscle tone do not improve and baby’s
chest is not moving during bag and mask ventilation?</h3>

<p>Possible reasons for ineffective ventilation:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="#seal">Inadequate seal.</a></li>
<li> <a href="#blocked">Blocked airway.</a></li>
<li> <a href="#pressure">Not enough pressure is being used to inflate the lungs.</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="seal">1. Inadequate seal</h3>

<p>If you hear or feel air escaping from around the mask, reapply the mask to the face and try to form
a better seal. Use a little more pressure on the rim of the mask and lift the jaw a little more forward.
Do not press down hard on the baby’s face. The most common place for a leak to occur is between
the cheek and bridge of the nose.</p>

<h3>Why is establishing a seal between the mask and the face so important?</h3>

<p>An airtight seal between the rim of the mask and the face is essential to achieve the
positive pressure required to inflate the lungs with the bag.</p> 

<figure>
<a href="../assets/images/coin22.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin22.png" max-width="100%"/></a>
 <figcaption><small><b>Inadequate seal</b><br/>
If  you hear air escaping from the mask,form a better seal. <br/>
The commonest leak is between the nose and the cheeks.</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="blocked">2. Blocked Airway</h3>

<p>Another possible reason for insufficient ventilation of the baby’s lungs is a blocked airway.</p>
<p> To correct this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check the baby’s position and extend the neck a bit further.</li>
<li>Check the mouth, oropharynx and nose for secretions; suction the mouth and
nose if necessary.</li>
<li>Try ventilating with the baby's mouth slightly open (especially helpful in extremely
small premature babies with very small nares).</li>
<li>Place a Guedel airway (oropharnygeal tube) to help keep the airway open.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pressure">3. Not Enough Pressure</h3>

<p>Gradually increase the pressure by squeezing the bag more every few breaths until there are visible
chest movement with each breath. If this does not work, occlude the pop off valve for a few breaths to
see if the chest moves better</p>

<h3>What else is necessary if BMV is exceeding 2 min?</h3>

<p>The problems related to gastric/abdominal distention and aspiration of gastric contents can be
reduced by inserting an orogastric tube, aspirating gastric contents, and leaving the gastric tube in
place and uncapped to act as a vent for stomach gas throughout the remainder of the
resuscitation.</p>

<h2>C.</h2>  Make certain that there is adequate <b><u>Circulation</u></b> of oxygenated blood.

<h2 id="circulation">C - Chest Compression</h2>

<h3>What are the indications for beginning chest compressions?</h3>

<p>Chest compressions should be started whenever the heart rate remains less than 60 bpm despite
effective positive-pressure ventilation. You assess the heart rate after the first 30 seconds of
effective ventilation. Check the heart rate by palpating the base of the umbilical cord or listen with
a stethoscope over the heart in the newborn. If the pulse is slow or absent in the neonate, give
BMV for 30 seconds and reassess. If it is still slow or absent, then start chest compressions.
</p>

<h3>How many people are needed to administer chest compressions, and where should they stand?</h3>

<p>Remember that chest compressions are of little value unless the lungs are also being ventilated.
Therefore, two people are required. One administers effective ventilation and one compresses
the chest. The one administering ventilation should position his/herself at the head and the one
doing chest compression at the side or foot of the baby.
</p>

<h3>How do you position your hands on the chest to administer chest
compressions?</h3>

<p>There are two techniques for performing chest compression: thumb technique and 2-finger
technique.</p>

<p><b>The Thumb Technique</b></p>

<p><b>How do you position your hands using the thumb technique?</b></p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin23.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin23.png" max-width="100%"/></a>

<p>The thumb technique is accomplished by encircling the thorax with both hands and placing the
thumbs on the sternum and the fingers under the baby’s back supporting the spine.</p>
<p>The thumbs can be placed side by side or, on a small baby, one over the other.</p>
<p>The thumbs will be used to compress the sternum, while your fingers provide the support needed
for the back. The thumbs should be flexed at the first joint and pressure applied vertically to
compress the heart between the sternum and the spine. Lift your thumbs off the chest during
ventilation to avoid restricting effective ventilation.</p>


<b><p>The 2-Finger Technique</b></p>
<p><b>How do you position your hands using the 2-finger technique?</b><p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin23aa.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin23aa.png" max-width="100%"/></a>
<p>The 2-finger technique is the technique where the tips of the middle finger and either the index
finger or ring finger of one hand are used to compress the sternum, while the other hand is used
to support the baby’s back (unless the baby is on a very firm surface). This is not as effective as
the technique above.</p>
<p>In the 2-finger technique, the tips of the middle finger and either the index or ring finger of one hand
are used for compressions. Position the 2-fingers perpendicular to the chest as shown and press
with the fingertips. As with the thumb technique, apply pressure vertically to compress the heart
between the sternum and the spine.</p>
	
<h3>Where on the chest should you position your thumbs or fingers?</h3>

<a href="../assets/images/coin24b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin24b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Hands should be positioned on the lower third of the sternum, half way
between the xiphoid and a line drawn between the nipples. You can quickly
locate the correct area on the sternum by running your fingers along the
lower edge of the ribs until you locate the xiphoid.</p>

<p>Then place your thumbs or fingers immediately above the xiphoid. Care
must be taken to avoid putting pressure directly on the xiphoid.</p>

<h3>How much pressure do you use to compress the chest?</h3>

<p>Controlling the pressure used in compressing the sternum is an important part of the procedure. 
With the fingers and hands correctly positioned, use enough pressure to depress the sternum to a depth of approximately 
<u>one third</u> of the anterior posterior diameter of the chest and then release the pressure 
to allow the heart to refill. One compression consists of the downward stroke plus the release. The actual distance 
compressed will depend on the size of the baby.</p>

<p><b>Are there dangers associated with administering chest compressions?</b></p>

<p>Chest compressions can cause trauma to the baby. Two vital organs lie within the rib cage; the
heart and lungs. Pressure applied too low, over the xiphoid, can cause laceration of the liver.
Although the ribs are compressible, care must be taken not to cause injury.</p>

<h3>How often do you coordinate compressions with ventilation?</h3>
<p><b><em>Three compressions to one BMV i.e. a ratio of 3:1</b></em></p>

<p>After approximately 30 seconds of well-coordinated chest compressions and ventilation, stop
compressions long enough to determine the heart rate again. Feel the pulse at the base of the
cord.</p>

<p><b>If the heart rate is now above 60 bpm</b><br>Discontinue chest compressions, but continue positive-pressure ventilation now at a more rapid
rate of 40 to 60 breaths per minute.<br>Once the heart rate rises above 60 bpm and the baby begins to breathe spontaneously, slowly
withdraw positive pressure ventilation and assess for spontaneous ventilation.</p>

<p><b>If the heart rate remains below 60 bpm</b><br>Despite good ventilation of the lungs with positive-pressure ventilation and improved cardiac output
from chest compressions, a very small number of newborns (fewer than 2 per 1,000 births) will
still have a heart rate below 60 bpm. Continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation until the heart rate
rises and remains above 100 bpm.</p>

<p><b>What should you do if the baby is in shock, there is evidence of blood loss, and the
baby is responding poorly to resuscitation?</b></p>
<p>

<p>Babies in shock appear pale, have delayed capillary refill and have weak pulses. They may have a
persistently low heart rate, and circulatory status often does not improve in response to effective
ventilation and chest compressions. If the baby appears to be in shock and is not responding to
resuscitation, administration of a volume expander (fluids) and blood may be indicated.</p>

<h2>What should you do after a baby has been successfully resuscitated?</h2>

<p>Babies who required prolonged resuscitation with bag and mask ventilation and/or chest
compressions are likely to have been severely stressed. Following resuscitation, some babies will
breathe normally some will have ongoing respiratory distress. All babies should have a heart rate
above 100 bpm and normal SpO2 by 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Babies requiring bag and mask ventilation (more than 5 minutes) and/or chest compressions
require post resuscitation care, will need to be transferred to the newborn care unit and be kept
warm during transfer. They require ongoing evaluation, monitoring and management.

<h2 id="cessation" style="color:blue;"> Cessation of resuscitation</h2>

<p>It is appropriate to discontinue after effective resuscitation efforts if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Infant is not breathing and heartbeat is not detectable beyond 10 min</li>
<li>If no spontaneous breathing and heart rate remains below 60/min after 20 min of
effective resuscitation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Record the event and explain to the mother or parents that the infant has died, if confirmed. Give them the
infant to hold if they so wish.</p>
