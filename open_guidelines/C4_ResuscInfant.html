<h1 align="center" style="color:blue;">Resuscitation of the Young Infant (Chapter 4)</h1> 
 <hr class="yellowline" />
 
<p>See <a href="#NYIresusc"> young infant resuscitation algorithm</a> for an overview</p>


<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<i>After completion of this chapter the participant should be able to:</i>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the  <a href="#resuscNYI">resusciation or a sick young infant.</a></li>
 </ul>
 <hr class="yellowline" />
   
<p>This chapter covers resuscitation of a young infant (resuscitation of a baby from 29 days to 60 
days). There are a lot of similarities with <a class="seealso" href="C3_ResuscNewborn.html"> neonatal 
resuscitation</a> and the skills required 
are similar.<br />
<b>The resuscitation of the YI is very similar to the newborn, except for the initial steps
and ratio of breathes to cardiac compressions. </b></p>

This chapter also includes <br/>
The insertion of a <a href="#guedel">guedel</a> (oropharyngeal) airway


<p><b>First make sure baby is warm and blood sugar is normal.</b></p>

<h2 id="AandB" style="color:blue;">Managing Airway and Breathing</h2>

<p>The letters <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in <q><b>ABCCCD</b></q> represent <q>airway and breathing</q>.
To assess if the child has an airway or breathing problem you need to know: </p>

<ul>
<li> Is the <a href="#airway">airway</a> open?</li>
<li> Is the child <a href="#breathing">breathing</a>?</li>
<li> Is the child blue (centrally cyanosed)?</li>
<li> Does the child have severe respiratory distress?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="guedel">Insertion of an Oropharyngeal (Guedel) Airway</h3>

<p>The oropharyngeal or Guedel airway can be used in an unconscious infant to improve airway 
opening. It may not be tolerated in a patient who is awake and may induce choking or vomiting. 
Guedel airways come in different sizes; an appropriately sized airway goes from the angle of the 
mouth to the angle of the jaw when laid on the face with the convex side up.</p>


<p><b>Insert an oropharyngeal airway in an infant, convex 
side up.</b></p> 
<p><a href="../assets/images/coin4.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin4.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<ul>
<li>Select an appropriately sized airway.</li>
<li>Position the child to open the airway.</li>
<li>Insert the oropharyngeal airway the convex side up.</li>
<li>Re-check airway opening.</li>
<li>Use a different sized airway or reposition if necessary.</li></ul></p>

<h3 id="breathing" style="color:blue;">B. Breathing</h3>
<p><b>Does the child have Severe Respiratory Distress?</b></p>
<p><a href="../assets/images/coin5.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin5.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<p>Is there difficulty in breathing while 
breastfeeding? Is the baby breathing 
<strong>very fast,</strong> has <strong>severe lower chest wall 
in-drawing,</strong> or using the accessory 
muscles for breathing which cause the 
head to nod with every inspiration? Are 
there any abnormal noises heard when 
breathing? A short noise when breathing 
out in young infants is called grunting. 
Grunting is a sign of severe respiratory
distress.</p>


<p><b>Signs of severe respiratory distress:</b></p>

<ul>
<li> Grunting</li> 
<li> Head nodding</li>
<li> Respiratory rate >60/min</li> 
<li> Severe lower chest in-drawing</li> 
<li> Apnoeic spells</li>
<li> Unable to feed due to respiratory distress</li> 
<li> Cyanosis</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Giving oxygen to a baby with respiratory distress.</b></p>
<p>A baby with severe respiratory distress should be allowed to take a comfortable position of his 
choice and should be given oxygen. Oxygen may be provided with a catheter or prongs. If the 
baby’s breathing difficulty worsens or the baby has central cyanosis while on catheter or prongs: 
<u>add</u> oxygen at a high flow rate via a face mask (4 litres/min), if available.</p>

<p><b>Management of airway in a child with gasping or who has just stopped breathing.</b></p>

<p>If the baby is not breathing, you need to manage the airway and support the breathing with a bag 
and mask.</p>

<h3>Ventilate with bag and mask (BMV).</h3>

<p>If the child is not breathing even after the above manoeuvres or spontaneous ventilation is 
inadequate (as judged by insufficient chest movements and inadequate breath sounds), ventilate 
with a self-inflating bag and mask.<br/>
During bag and mask ventilation, it may be necessary to move the baby’s head and neck gently 
through a range of positions to determine the optimum position for airway patency and 
effectiveness of ventilation. A neutral position without hyperextension of the neck is usually 
appropriate for infants.<br/>
Infants may need padding under the shoulders to prevent excessive flexion of the neck that occurs
when their prominent occiput rests on the surface on which the child lies.</p>

<p><b>Call for help in any child who needs Bag and Mask Ventilation (BMV) since some 
of these infants may additionally need chest compression.</b></p>


<p>After five effective ventilations, check the pulse (femoral) for 10 seconds. If pulse is absent, the
second person should start chest compression.</p>

<h3 id="chest compressions" style="color:blue;">C. Chest Compressions (as in <a class="seealso" href
="C3_ResuscNewborn.html"> neonatal resuscitation</a>)</h3>

<p>Note: while it is often possible to resuscitate a baby who has stopped breathing but still has a 
good heart beat, i.e., a respiratory arrest, it is almost never possible to resuscitate a baby whose 
heart has stopped, i.e., a cardiorespiratory arrest.</p>

<p>Chest compressions are done as in neonates. One cycle will consist of<strong> 15 compressions plus 
2 ventilation breaths.</strong></p>

<h2>E 1 Suction Machine (Pump)</h2>
A suction machine is life-saving equipment which is often needed in resuscitation of the young infant. 
See the equipment chapter<a class="seealso" href="E1_Suctionpump.html"> on suction machine</a> for more information.
