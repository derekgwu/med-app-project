<h2 style="color:blue;">Introduction</h2>

<p>The NYI is most vulnerable to hypothermia during the first few hours after birth, although the 
condition may occur later too, for example during bathing, on a cold night, or during transportation, 
if measures to keep the baby warm are inadequate.<em> Sick or low birth weight babies admitted to
neonatal units with hypothermia are more likely to die than those admitted with normal
temperatures.</em></p>

<h3 <a id="thermometer"> Temperature Recording Using a Digital Thermometer</a></h3>

<p><em>Axillary temperature: </em>This method is the routine practice for measuring temperature. It has fewer 
risks than rectal measurements in terms of injury or infection. Point the tip of the thermometer to 
the shoulder not the bed to avoid the thermometer reading the air temperature. Record the 
temperature after the reading has stabilized with a bleep.</p>

<p><em>Rectal temperature:</em> Do not use this method for routine monitoring. However, it is the best guide 
for core temperature in cold (hypothermic) sick neonates. Lubricate the thermometer, insert the 
tip of the thermometer into the rectum not more than an inch. Record the temperature after the 
reading has stabilized with a bleep.</p>

<h3>Assessment of Temperature by Touch</h3>

<p>An easy way to assess a newborn baby’s temperature is by <q>touch</q>. This can be easily taught to 
caregivers. The baby’s abdomen is felt with the back of hand and compared with their own 
forehead. Abdominal temperature represents the core temperature and it is reliable in the
diagnosis of hypothermia. Warm and pink feet of the baby indicate that the baby is in thermal
comfort. But when feet are cold and trunk is warm, it indicates that the baby has cold stress.</p>

<h2 id="classification" style="color:blue;">Classification of Hypothermia</h2>

<p><b>The NYI has a normal body temperature between 36.5-37.4<sup>o</sup>C.</b></p>

<p>A community-based study has found that mortality increased by approximately 80% for 
every degree Celsius decrease in first observed axillary temperature, and that relative 
risk of death ranged from 2 to 30 times for <b>moderate hypothermia</b>, increasing with 
greater severity of hypothermia (<a class="seealso" href="bibl.html">5</a>). A study in India that included only hypothermic babies 
on admission found mortality ranged from 39.3% for mild hypothermia, 51% <b>for moderate 
hypothermia</b> to 80% for severe hypothermia. Moderate hypothermia has a much worse
outcome when associated with other newborn problems and fatality rates increase to 71% 
when the baby is also hypoglycaemic, 83% when also hypoxic and 90% when shocked 
(<a class="seealso" href="bibl.html">6</a>).</p>


<p>In Malawi hypothermia has been shown to contribute to mortality in neonates with RDS 
even when they receive appropriate respiratory support such as oxygen or bCPAP. None 
of the neonates who had an average temperature of less than 35.8<sup>o</sup>C survived to 
discharge. Correction of the hypothermia resulted in improved outcomes and benefit from 
bCPAP – in this cohort all 30 neonates for whose temperature readings were more than 
35.8<sup>o</sup>C more than half the time survived regardless of their initial temperature.</p>

<h3 id="lose heat">Four ways a neonate may lose heat to the environment:</h3>

<p>Newborn baby’s temperature falls within seconds of being born and sick NYI are often 
hypothermic. If the temperature continues to fall the baby will become sick and may even 
die.</p>

<h2 id="prevent" style="color:blue;">The Warm Chain for the Newborn</h2>

<p>These are procedures to be taken at birth and during the next few hours and days in order 
to minimize heat loss in all newborns.</p>

<h3>10 steps in the warm chain:</h3>

<ol>
<li> <b>Warm delivery room </b>– when switching off the air conditioner wait for the room to warm
to 25 degrees Celsius (look at the room thermometer).</li>
<li> <b>Pre-warm two cloths</b> – use one immediately to dry the baby, discard this wet cloth and
wrap baby in the other dry cloth.</li>
<li> Immediate <b>drying</b> of a baby.</li>
<li> <b><a class="seealso" href="C3_ResuscNewborn.html">Resuscitation</a>
</b> – environment must be warm.</li>
<li> <b><a href="#sts">Skin-to-skin</a></b> – administer for the first 30 to 60 minutes, unless clinical complications. To
deliver skin-to-skin care the caregiver and baby must be kept together at all times.</li>
<li> <b> <a class="seealso" href="C2_Routine Care.html#Breastfeeding">Breastfeeding</a></b> 
– commence within the first hour, unless clinical contraindications.</li>
<li> <b><a href="#clothing">Clothing</a></b> – appropriate and warm clothing / bedding should be used.</li>
<li> <b>Transportation</b> – ensure warmth maintained by protecting the baby from draughts e.g., in
KMC position or well wrapped in warm clothing and with a hat.</li>
<li> <b><a href="#bathing">Bathing</a></b> – delay until at least 24 hours after birth.</li>
<li> <b>Training and awareness </b>– all healthcare professionals and caregivers should be trained
so the risks of hypothermia are minimised.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Prevention of Hypothermia in the Neonate</h2>

<h3 id="sts">Skin-to-skin Contact (Kangaroo Mother Care)</h3>

<p>If there are no signs of distress, a mother can provide a warm environment with skin to skin contact 
for the baby. If the baby is <2500 grams this should be continued as KMC. Place the baby, with 
a nappy and hat, upright inside mother’s clothing against mother’s bare skin over the chest. A
loose blouse, sweater, or wrap tied at the waist holds the baby. The baby should wear a hat. Let 
baby suckle at the breast as often as s/he wants, but at least every 2 hours. See also <a class="seealso" href="C9_Preterm.html#KMC">KMC</a>
</p>
<h3 id="bathing">Postpone Bathing </h3>

<p>Bathing should be delayed until at least 24 hours after birth. Blood, meconium, and some of the 
vernix will have been wiped off during drying at birth. The remaining vernix does not need to be 
removed as it is harmless, may reduce heat loss and is reabsorbed through the skin during the 
first days of life.</p>

<h3>Postpone Weighing </h3>

<p>Weighing the baby at birth puts him/her at risk of heat loss and should be postponed for at least 
two hours unless the room temperature is warm.</p>

<h3 id="clothing">Appropriate Clothing and Bedding</h3>

<p>As a rule, newborns need one or two more layers of clothing and bedding than adults. Covers 
should not be tight to allow air spaces between the layers as trapped air is a very efficient insulator. 
Keep ambient atmospheric temperature warm for baby’s weight and postnatal age. Monitor body 
temperature 4 hourly.</p>

<h3>Place in a hot-cot (warmer) when mother cannot stay with the baby.</h3>

<p>If a baby cannot stay with their mother for KMC, then a hot-cot is helpful. The Blantyre hot-cot is 
a simple incubator that uses four 60-watt light bulbs to raise the air temperature within the cot by 
1.5°C per light bulb. A baby may need one, two, three or all four bulbs to be on to stay warm. 
<u>Check the baby’s temperature after an hour </u>in the cot, and if the baby’s temperature increases,
turn off two bulbs to avoid overheating the baby and <u>recheck the baby’s temperature regularly.</u> It 
may be warm enough just to have one bulb, or no bulb on and the Perspex lid raised.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Signs and Symptoms of Hypothermia</h2>

<p>The body cannot function well when it is cold. There may be:</p>

<ul>
<li> Reduced activity / lethargy</li>
<li> Poor feeding</li>
<li> Weak cry</li>
<li> Respiratory distress</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C11_Hypoglycaemia.html">Hypoglycaemia</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="re-warm" style="color:blue;">Treatment of Established Hypothermia in the NYI </h2>

<p>The NYI should be re-warmed carefully and gradually to prevent seizures, the temperature needs
to rise by 0.5<sup>o</sup>C per hour. The method selected for re-warming will depend on how sick the NYI is 
and availability of mother, staff and equipment.</p>

<p><b>The methods to use include:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b> <a href="#sts">Skin-to-skin</a> is the ideal method </b>for clinically stable babies. Keep the baby with the
mother until the temperature is normal.</li>
<li> <b>In a hot-cot.</b> Remove baby’s cold clothes and replace with pre-warmed clothes and add
a hat. Functional incubators can also be used.</li>
<li> <b><a class="seealso" href="E8_Radiant Warmer.html">Radiant warmers,</a></b> though these are usually for short term use.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="supportive" style="color:blue;">Supportive Care</h2>
<ul>
<li> Continue <a class="seealso" href="C2_Routine Care.html#Breastfeeding">breast feeding</a>.</li>
<li> If infant too weak give expressed breast milk by cup, spoon or oro/nasogastric tube.</li>
<li> Assess for infection.</li>
<li> Monitor oxygen saturation and heart rate.</li>
<li> Monitor glucose.</li>
<li> Measure temperature hourly until 36.5<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
<li> Watch for <a class="seealso" href="C5_Breathing difficulties.html#apnoea">apnoea</a></li>
</ul>
