<h2 id="definition" style="color:blue;">Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (bCPAP)</h2>

<p><b>Definition:</b></p>

<p>A process of giving continuous flow of air under regulated pressure through the airway.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>bCPAP</strong> stands for bubble continuous positive airway pressure.</li>
<li> It is a constant pressure applied to the airway, generated by continuous, consistent
flow of air with the aim of opening collapsed lung segments and maintaining patency
in already opened air spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center"><p style="color:blue;">E7 Bubble CPAP</h2> 

<hr class="yellowline" />

<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>

<p><b>Bubble CPAP (bCPAP) devices provide both positive pressure & increased 
fractional concentration of oxygen (FiO2) to newborns with respiratory distress.</b></p>

<p>Bubble CPAP (bCPAP) is particularly useful for premature babies with 
<a class="seealso" href="C5_Breathing difficulties.html#RDS">RDS: respiratory distress syndrome</a>.<b>(1.1)</b></p>
 
<a href="../assets/images/coin77.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin77.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
 
<p>Very premature babies (&lt;1.5kg and &lt;32 weeks) benefit from early bCPAP.<b> (Alert 1.1)</b> 
Reference can be made to the <b><a href="#TRY">TRY algorithm</a></b>. Depending on your facility 
and your national policy the lowest weight at which to commence bCPAP may differ. 
bCPAP should only be used when essential newborn care is in place, the equipment 
is functioning, oxygen is available, staff are adequately trained in bCPAP, and close 
monitoring can be assured.</p>

</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <p>Regarding the initiation of bCPAP versus low flow oxygen on the day of
birth, protocol developers should consider the following functions and 
evidence. bCPAP functions to treat respiratory distress by improving
both ventilation (controlled provision of continuous inspiratory pressure)
and oxygenation [controlled provision of increased percentage of 
oxygen - termed the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)]. The positive  
pressure from bCPAP prevents lung tissue (alveolae) from collapsing  
on expiration thus improving ventilation, reducing the work of breathing  
and preventing potentially irreversible lung damage.<sup>1</sup> Additionally,
bCPAP has been shown to promote production of endogenous  
surfactant,<sup>2</sup> improve apnoea of prematurity<sup>3,4</sup> and dramatically decrease 
progression to mechanical ventilation,<sup>5-9</sup> or death, in both high 
income<sup>10,11</sup> and low income <sup>12-15</sup> settings.</p>
<p>Thus, early bCPAP for preterm & small newborns, especially in settings
where mechanical ventilation and surfactant are unavailable, is critical
to prevent death. At a minimum, evidence points to preferential early
initiation of bCPAP, rather than low flow oxygen, in preterm newborns 
under 1.5kg with any respiratory distress on the day of birth.</p>
</td>

<p>Bubble CPAP may also be used to treat neonatal patients with increased work of 
breathing, designated by nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, severe recession, RR 
&gt; 60, or an oxygen requirement of 0.5 to 1 L/min with peripheral blood saturations of
&lt; 90%, in premature or term infants. <b>(Alert 1.2)</b></p>


<p>Increased work of breathing may be caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li> Neonatal pneumonia</li>
<li> Severe transient tachypnoea of the newborn</li>
<li> Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C5_Breathing difficulties.html#apnoea">Apnoea</a>
 of prematurity<sup>3,4</sup></li>
<li> Meconium aspiration syndrome</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C15_Sepsis.html">Neonatal sepsis</a> with severe respiratory distress</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>The <b><a href="#TRY">TRY algorithm</a></b> may be used by a nurse or clinician to decide who would benefit 
from bCPAP and, if necessary, whom to prioritise. The TRY algorithm signs and 
symptoms on which to act are straight forward and easily carried out. Premature 
babies benefit most from CPAP and are given priority. Babies with severe asphyxia 
leading to poor tone will not benefit. If CPAP machines are few in number, it is 
important to provide CPAP to those who will benefit most. There are always exceptions 
and in tertiary care units a paediatrician may decide to give CPAP to other infants. 
Deciding when to start CPAP for a premature baby may differ between national 
guidelines. </p>

<p>Contraindications to bCPAP include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Significant bleeding from mouth and nose</li>
<li> Anatomical abnormalities of mouth and nose e.g., choanal atresia, cleft lip and palate</li>
<li> Other obvious malformations incompatible with life</li>
<li> Presence of a pneumothorax</li>
</ul>

<td>Scale & delivery of neonatal care is critical. However, epidemiological 
data has shown that rapid scale up of neonatal care without sufficient
attention to safety has long term negative consequences for neonatal
morbidity16 and is likely a contributor to the epidemic of preventable
blindness due to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in these settings.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Supplemental oxygen is life-saving. However, when given in supraoptimal doses, 
it has also been associated with ROP,<sup>18</sup>
bronchopulmonary dysplasia,<sup>19</sup> periventricular leukomalacia and
prolonged ventilation.<sup>20</sup> When using any form of oxygen therapy, it is
important to closely monitor blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels in
order to balance risks and benefits of supplemental oxygen. Exact blood
oxygen saturation targets for premature newborns remain an area of
controversy. However, most authorities agree that SpO 2 between 90-95%
is reasonable to minimise complications associated with low and high
oxygen levels.<sup>21-24</sup></p>
<p>When choosing between low flow oxygen and bCPAP it is important to
keep the following physiological considerations in mind. Newborns under
2.5kg receiving low flow oxygen exceeding 0.5 L/min are administered
40-100% effective FiO2,<sup>25-28</sup> which may increase morbidity. Delivery of
low flow oxygen in preterm newborns under 1.5kg has the added
complexity that positive pressure can be delivered even at flows as low
as 1-2.5 L/min.<sup>29,30</sup> Unfortunately, as discussed above, at these rates of
low-flow oxygen, preterm newborns would be exposed to elevated levels
of effective FiO 2 which data show are likely to increase their morbidity.</p>
<p>In light of the above evidence and expert opinion, the recommendation
was made by our consortium to consider bCPAP in appropriate settings
when low flow oxygen greater than 0.5 - 1 L/min is required to maintain
saturations >90%. Of note, this recommendation is in line with the WHO
recommendation that a standard flow rate for neonates is 0.5 – 1L/min in
<u>WHO Oxygen Therapy for Children;</u><sup>31</sup> however, it is unaligned with the
suggestion to consider 4L/min of oxygen as the transition threshold from
nasal prongs to bCPAP.</p>

<p><b>Respiratory distress can cause hypoxia contributing to both morbidity and 
mortality. Bubble CPAP devices (2.1) use a pump to provide a blend of air and 
oxygen at a continuous positive pressure. This pressure keeps airway spaces 
open and increases alveolar recruitment throughout respiration in a 
spontaneously breathing infant, which improves oxygenation and reduces work 
of breathing.</b></p>

<p><small>Zoom in to see details</small></p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin82a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin82a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Traditional bCPAP devices are made up of the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Pump:</b> pumps in air mixed with oxygen from an oxygen source.</li>
<li> <b>Inspiratory tube:</b> connects the blended air and oxygen flow source to the patient.</li>
<li> <b>Expiratory tube:</b> connects the patient to the pressure regulator.</li>
<li> <b>Pressure regulator:</b> a water reservoir placed at the end of the expiratory circuit that
provides pressure using water level.</li>
</ul>

<p>bCPAP devices range in complexity from vitals measured (e.g., saturations/respiratory 
rates measured on the device) to outputs (e.g., humidified pressure vs pure pressure).
<b>(Alert 2.1)</b></p>

<p>Pressures used in bCPAP devices range from 5 to 10 cm of water. As bCPAP delivers 
a blend of air and oxygen, staff should also carefully monitor patients for oxygen 
saturation using a pulse oximeter. Neonatal patients should reach oxygen saturations 
of 90 – 95% by 15 minutes after birth. <b>(Alert 2.2)</b></p>

<td bgcolor="#99CCFF"><b>ALERT 2.1  Use  of  humidification  in bCPAP</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Some bCPAP  units  use  heated  and humidified gas  in the circuit although
the exact benefits of humidification in non-invasive ventilation (i.e.,
bCPAP) in terms of survival, complications from therapy & morbidity are
not well established. For a more thorough review of theoretical
risk/benefits of heated humidified oxygen in bCPAP, 
see <b><a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a>.</b></p>
<p>Potential benefits of heating and humidification could include:
<ul>
<li> Increased comfort and adherence.</li>
<li> Decreased upper airway mucosal injury.</li>
<li> Decreased convective heat losses which may lead to hypothermia
& challenging weight gain in infants.</li>
<li> Decreased lung inflammation from mucus plugs which has
unknown impact on morbidity & mortality of very low birth weight
infants.</li>
</ul>

Potential drawbacks to heated humidification include:
<ul>
<li>Hospital-acquired infection, especially in settings where clean
water may not be readily available and humidifiers, which are
typically meant for one-time use, are being cleaned and re-used
between patients.<sup>32</sup></li>
<li> High financial cost of adding heated humidified gas.<sup>33</sup></li>
<li> High human resource cost in terms of repair and preparation of 
non-invasive ventilation units which may limit not only their use, but 
availability of this life saving technology within our setting.<sup>33</sup></li>
</ul>
<p></p>In summary, based mostly on expert opinion, it is likely that heated and
humidified air is most important for the smallest newborns &lt;1 -1.25kg
although this has never been explicitly studied. There is evidence from
Malawi that unheated un-humidified bCPAP can be used successfully to
decrease mortality of infants without excessive reports of upper airway
complications, but physiological implications in terms of morbidity and
mortality (hypothermia & weight gain) were not explicitly studied. Of note,
survival of infants >1.5kg on un-heated un-humidified air bCPAP in this
study<sup>12</sup> were similar to survival of infants &gt;1.5kg in Rwanda on heated
and humidified bCPAP.<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>At this time, based on expert opinion and available literature, it does not
appear that the benefits of humidification outweigh the potential
risks/drawbacks for infants >1kg. Further study of the degree of humidity
provided by compressed air in various settings as well as implications of
humidification in low resource settings on iatrogenic infections, morbidity,
and mortality of neonates is needed.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">PREPARING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Place patient on oxygen and keep the baby warm whilst preparing for bCPAP.</li>
<li> Always explain the purpose, risks, and benefits of a procedure to guardians BEFORE 
performing the procedure. </li>
<li> Follow handwashing protocol.</li>
<li> Collect: </li>
<ul>
<li> Hat or length of stockinette (if hat is not available)</li>
<li> Orogastric tube (OGT)</li>
<li> Gloves</li>
<li> Syringe</li>
<li> Tape</il>
<li> Suction catheter</li>
<li> Correctly sized bCPAP prongs</li>
</ul>

<li> If a hat is not available, make a hat from a length of stockinette. <b>(3.11)</b></li>
 <a href="../assets/images/coin90.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin90.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Wash hands and put on gloves. Using suctioning guidelines, suction the 
patient’s nose and mouth using the suction catheter if clinically indicated. <b>(3.12)</b></li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin91.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin91.png" max-width="50%"/></a><br/>

<br/><li> Insert an OGT: <b>(Alert 3.1)</b></li><br />
<ol>
<li> Place the patient’s head in a neutral position, measure from the middle 
of the mouth to the ear and then to halfway between the xiphisternum 
and umbilicus. Mark this distance with a small amount of tape. 

<li> Gently insert the OGT in the mouth to this length. 

<li> Tape the OGT to the chin to keep in place. Use appropriate tape for 
delicate newborn skin.

<li> Check placement of the OGT.<sup>36</sup></li>
<ul>
<li> Using a syringe aspirate gastric contents. Test with litmus paper. The
litmus paper’s colour change should reflect an acidic pH (&le;6); if it does
not, the OGT is incorrectly placed and should be re-sited. NOTE: Litmus
paper is manufactured in different colours. Acidic pH may be indicated by
different colour changes depending on manufacturer.</li>
<li> If no gastric contents are aspirated, perform a whoosh test: push 2ml of air
down the OGT whilst listening over the abdomen with a stethoscope. If no
gurgling sound is heard the OGT is incorrectly placed and should be resited.</li>
<li> If no gastric contents are aspirated and a whoosh test is not viable, an
alternative method is to place the OGT end into water. If continuous
bubbling occurs, the OGT is incorrectly placed and should be re-sited.</li>
</ul>
<li> Select bCPAP prong size from 000 to 5 based on nostril size. bCPAP prongs 
should completely fill the patient’s nostrils. If prongs do not fill the nostril 
completely, the pressure delivered to the patient will be decreased. If nostrils 
turn a white colour the prongs are too tight and should be exchanged for the 
next size down.</li>

<li> Hat</li>
<li> 2-mL syringe filled with normal saline</li>
<li> Hat clips OR</li>
<li> 2 rubber bands & 4 safety pins</li>
</ul>
<li> Turn on the bCPAP device and connect oxygen source. Place hat on patient.</li>
<li> Determine initial settings for the patient. Most patients will start with a pressure 
level of 6 cm water, total flow of 6 L/min and oxygen concentration (FiO2) of 
50%. Determine oxygen flow using FiO2 and total flow as shown on the oxygen 
blending table printed on top of device. <b>(3.14)</b></li>
 <a href="../assets/images/coin92.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin92.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
 <a href="../assets/images/coin92a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin92a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Set total flow. Set oxygen flow on both oxygen source and bCPAP oxygen 
flowmeter.</li>
<li> Connect correctly sized bCPAP prongs to the inspiratory and expiratory tubing. 
Retest the bubbling by pinching the bCPAP prongs shut.</li>
<li> If the water within the pressure regulating bottle bubbles:</li>
<ul>
<li> Using syringe filled with saline, place a drop of saline within each nostril. </li>
<li> Gently insert the prongs into the nostrils with the writing on the prongs facing 
towards the caregiver.</li>
<li> bCPAP prongs should be inserted until the line on the bCPAP prongs is just 
visible. This will leave 1 mm of space between the prongs and the nasal septum 
to aid nasal patency. <b>(3.15)</b></li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin93.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin93.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

</ul>
<li> Secure inspiratory and expiratory tubing to the patient using hat clips. <b>(3.16)</b> If 
hat clips are unavailable, secure using rubber bands & safety pins:</li>
<ul>
<li> Insert two safety pins on each side of the head in the brim of the hat. Pins 
should open away from the baby’s face and should go only through the folded 
brim of the hat. Pins should never touch the patient’s skin.</li>
 <a href="../assets/images/coin93a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin93a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Hold the inspiratory tubing in place between the two safety pins. Wrap the 
rubber bands around the safety pins on either side of the tubing to secure. 
Repeat for the expiratory tubing on the other side of the patient’s face. <b>(3.17)</b></li>
<li> Recheck that the prongs are still within the nose and inserted to the correct 
distance from the nasal septum. </li>
<li> Sometimes a small folded cloth placed under the baby’s shoulders prevents 
the neck from bending and improves air/oxygen flow.</li>

<br/>
<li> Check that the water within the pressure regulating bottle bubbles. If it does not 
bubble, check that the prongs completely fill the patient’s nostrils. If they do not, 
replace with appropriately sized prongs.</li> 
<li> Monitor the patient 15 minutes after initiating bCPAP treatment and then 4 
hourly for:</li>
<ul>
<li> Vital signs, including respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation and 
temperature</li>
<li> Work of breathing</li>
<li> Nasal blockages</li>
<li> Abdominal distension</li>
</ul>
<li> Act in accordance to clinical findings.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">CARING FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<p>Monitoring the patient should be completed 4 hourly, but may be required more 
frequently depending on clinical condition. Monitoring should include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Vital signs, including respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature</li>
<li> Work of breathing </li>
<li> Nasal blockages</li>
<li> Abdominal distension</li>

<p>At every monitoring point:</p>

<ol>
<li> Provide a drop of saline to each nostril. <b>(3.18)</b></li>
<li> Check prongs, tubing & hat: </li>
<li> Prongs should not be against nasal septum and check for skin compromise</li>
<ul>
<li> Tubing should not be kinked or misplaced</li>
<li> Hat should not be loose; if it is loose, replace with new hat</li>
</ul>

<li> Check water level: if water level is below decided treatment level, add water 
into bottle cap hole using a syringe or OG tube. <b>(3.19)</b> Water should be changed 
daily.</li>

guidelines. <b>(Alert 4.1)</b> Any patient-related tubing must be cleaned before it 
is used to place another patient on bCPAP. Nasal prongs are especially difficult 
to clean thoroughly. Tubing should be hung to dry after disinfection and should 
not touch the floor or other unsanitary surfaces whilst drying. Any item falling 
on the floor is contaminated and must be cleaned thoroughly again.</li>
<li> All patient-related consumables should be stored in a clean, dry location. 
Tubing should be stored in loose rolls, preventing sharp bends or kinks which 
will decrease the lifetime of the tubing.</li>

<td>Respiratory circuits and humidifiers associated with bCPAP are generally
intended as single use devices. However, in areas with limited resources
or challenging supply chains this equipment is often re-used. When reprocessing
single use devices it is extremely important that the process
is not delayed following completion of use. There should be a detailed
standard of practice as well as oversight processes for ensuring timely
and high-quality re-processing. If equipment is not re-processed promptly
or adequately between patients it poses a significant infection risk. Please
refer to the <u>Reference Manual for Health Care Facilities with Limited
Resources Infection Prevention and Control Module 6</u><sup>37</sup> for more detailed
guidance on the re-processing of single use devices.

<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Turn off bCPAP and dispose of water within pressure regulating water bottle. </li>
<li> Dispose of hat and follow protocols for cleaning tubing if reusing prongs, 
inspiratory and expiratory tubing. If patient consumables are not cleaned 
thoroughly before using, infection can be transmitted. Care should be taken 
particularly for consumables that are marked as single-use but are practically 
reused.</li>
<li> Clean the outside of the bCPAP device using a swab soaked in alcohol or 
diluted chlorine. Total and oxygen flowmeter regulator controls should be 
disinfected after each use using a cotton swab or gauze soaked in 70% alcohol.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li><b> Nasal blockage:</b> the bCPAP prongs and nostrils can become blocked with mucus
which may result in increased respiratory distress and impaired oxygen delivery
resulting in hypoxia.</li>
<li><b> Necrotic nasal septum: </b>incorrectly sized or applied bCPAP prongs may result in
pressure on the nasal septum with resultant necrosis (tissue breakdown).</li>
<li><b> Gastric distension: </b>delivery of continuous airway pressure can cause gastric
distension and potential feed intolerance. The OGT should be closed for 30-60 min
after feeding but otherwise the OGT should be kept open on free drainage as this may
relieve distension.</li>
<li><b> Pneumothorax:</b> delivery of bCPAP occasionally causes a pneumothorax. If a patient
suddenly deteriorates whilst on bCPAP with increased respiratory distress and
worsening hypoxia assess for a pneumothorax.</li>
<li><b> Decreased cardiac output:</b> with excessive bCPAP levels, venous return may be
reduced resulting in decreased cardiac output.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Pressure leakages:</b> if the water in the bottle is not bubbling, it is likely that the patient
is not getting therapeutic pressures. This may be due to the patient’s mouth being open
or bCPAP prongs not fully fitting the patient’s nostrils. It could also be caused by
kinking of the tube or a loose tube connection.
<b><a href="#Troubleshooting">Bubble CPAP: Troubleshooting &
Repair</a>| If the water in the bottle is not bubbling </b>to identify and manage potential
causes for no bubbling.</li>
<li> <b>Power failure:</b> bCPAP should ideally always be utilising outlets that have a source of
back-up power. If the power supply fails and patients are <b>NOT</b> on outlets with back-up
power they should be moved to outlets where back up power is available. If no back
up power is available the baby should receive oxygen from an oxygen cylinder until
they can be safely returned to bCPAP.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime.</b></p>
<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>Mains power.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>The bubble CPAP device should be secured in an easily accessible and visible 
location near an oxygen source where nursing staff can regulate flows and manage 
patients easily, but where it is not at risk of falling. All consumables required to place 
a patient on bCPAP should be near the device and readily available to start treatment. 
bCPAP devices vibrate during use; ensure that the vibration is not causing excess 
sound (e.g., if placed on a table with metal instruments that will vibrate with the bCPAP 
device).</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>Minimal preventive maintenance is required for bCPAP devices. The bCPAP device 
should be turned on weekly to a total flow of 10 L/min and allowed to run while 
connected to an oxygen source at 2 L/min for at least 15 minutes. This is important to 
ensure device functioning and minimise infection risk within internal respiratory
circuits. </p>

<h3>Heated & Humidified Air in Non-Invasive Ventilation</h3>

<p>When breathing, air is physiologically heated and humidified as it passes through our 
upper airways into the lungs. Artificial heating and humidification are essential in 
invasive ventilation (i.e., when using ventilators) which bypasses the upper airways.
However, the risks and benefits of heating and humidifying air supplied through non-invasive ventilator techniques such as Highflow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) and bCPAP 
are not well established and currently there is not consensus about whether or not it 
is a necessary element of all non-invasive ventilation systems.<sup>38,39</sup></p>


<p>Benefits of heated and humidified gas in non-invasive ventilation may include 
increased adherence and comfort.38 In neonates specifically, there is a physiological 
argument that removal of heated and humidified gas may lead to increased convective 
heat losses and therefore increased metabolic demand as well as increased insensible 
fluid losses. One needs to consider if these effects may or may not have significant 
effects on the infant’s ability to maintain their temperature and grow adequately during 
the first weeks of life impacting mortality. In the long term, the effect of removing 
humidification on morbidity of infants (specifically in terms of development of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia) is also unknown.40 Lastly, heated humidified bCPAP 
may lead to lower incidence of mucosal injury which, in one study, was linked to 
increased rates of sepsis in extremely low birthweight infants41; however, early data 
from Malawi demonstrated few mucosal injuries when using un-heated un-humidified 
bCPAP.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>Risks of humidification include a theoretical risk of infection especially in settings 
where clean water may not be readily available and humidifiers, which are typically 
meant for one time use, are being cleaned and re-used between patients.<sup>32</sup> In addition, 
humidification incurs a high financial cost as well as human resource costs in terms of 
repair and preparation of non-invasive ventilation units which may limit not only their 
use, but availability of this life saving technology within low resource settings.<sup>33</sup></p>

<p>There is reason to believe that when supplying ambient air through the upper airway 
there is in fact, no need for heated humidification.
<sup>33</sup> This may be doubly true in low 
resource bCPAP units such as the Pumani which, rather than using compressed air 
sources (i.e., cylinders) are in fact driving flow through the circuit using compressed 
ambient air.<sup>42</sup> It is worth noting that although some lower cost bCPAP models do offer 
passive humidification, expert opinion and experience suggests that perhaps the level 
of humidification achieved via this method is not significant (data unpublished). Of 
note, although the studies differ significantly, reported survival rates for infants >1.5kg 
in Rwanda on a heated and humidified bCPAP circuit<sup>34 </sup>were similar to those reported 
in Malawi on an un-heated, un-humidified circuit.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>In conclusion, despite recent WHO recommendations that bCPAP units should contain 
humidification.<sup>31</sup> In light of primary data which shows (1) the unknown necessity, (2) 
the risks and benefits of heated and humidified gas in non-invasive ventilation, and (3) 
the life-saving implications bCPAP has for neonates, our consortium maintains there 
is a lack of evidence to resolve the question of humidification at this time. Further study 
of the degree of humidity provided by compressed air in various settings as well as 
implications of humidification in low resource settings on iatrogenic infections, 
morbidity and mortality of neonates is needed. It is important that when considering 
implementation of bCPAP, one considers not only physiological implications of this 
feature in the bCPAP units, but also how this feature impacts supply chain, human 
resource costs, financial costs, training, infection control, maintenance, and availability 
of units in country.</p>
