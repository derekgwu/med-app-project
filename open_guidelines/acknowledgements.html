<p>The Ministry of Health (MoH) would like to extend sincere thanks to those who generously
provided their input to the development of this course, including each member of the stakeholder
group and the facilitators and candidates at the pilot course. We acknowledge UNICEF Malawi
who supported the initial development of the Care of the Infant and Newborn (COIN) course and
continues to support its roll out; NEST360° (Rice University and Malawi College of Medicine) who
have supported updating the COIN material, developed and installed appropriate technologies in
the Sick Newborn Care Units, provided training material and incorporated these into the COIN
training material. We would also like to acknowledge members, past and present, of the
Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, both Blantyre and Lilongwe campuses, at the
University of Malawi College Of Medicine who have contributed to the material in the COIN course
through their input into guidelines developed over the years. Thanks to members of the Paediatric
and Child Health Association in Malawi (PACHA) who lead the development and revision of the
course and continue to support its implementation. Thanks to all healthcare staff in Malawi, who
contributed ideas and time to develop this document and who strive daily to ensure provision of
optimal care to neonates and young infants. The MoH also appreciates Bernadette O’Hare,
Kondwani Kawaza, Rizine Mzikamanda, Josephine Langton, Sara Liaghati-Mobarhan, Emmie
Mbale and Elizabeth Molyneux, for the development of the manual and associated material; and
Norman Lufesi, Ajib Phiri, Queen Dube, Chikondi Chimbatata, Hanny Friesen, Laura Newberry,
Andreas Hansmann, George Chagaluka, and Sara Desai for their input. In particular we would
like to acknowledge the contributions of Elizabeth Moylneux, Emmie Mbale and Sara Desai who
reviewed, formatted and edited the whole document.</p>

<p>The MoH is grateful to all the creators and developers of several life support courses especially
WHO, the ETAT and ETAT+ teams in Africa, and the Child and Newborn Health Group. Much of
the material from these courses has been gratefully borrowed and adapted for this COIN manual.
All the trainings and the approaches to training are intended to be as consistent as possible with
the WHO / UNICEF Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) programme and
initiatives such as the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), Help Babies Breathe (HBB) and
Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT) that are implemented in Malawi. The basic
text describing the evidence-based care promoted through this course is the WHO’s ‘Pocketbook
of Hospital Care for Children’ and in the Guidelines and Protocols for Neonatal and Young Infant
Care in Malawi. The manual has been complemented with the NEST 360 modules which are
evidence based and have peer reviewed and have been published. As such, COIN guidelines is
a blend of established guidelines put together to provide the best approach for our setting. This is
a course about care of newborns and infants and though accidents can happen at this age, trauma
is rare and therefore it has been omitted from this course.</p>

<p>We appreciate the critical role that the good care of mothers makes to the outcomes of neonates
and young infants and are committed to working collaboratively with our colleagues in maternal
health towards our common goal of improving maternal and child health in Malawi.</p>
