<p><b>Here the principles of using a syringe driver (pump) are presented.</b></p>

<p>Syringe drivers are available from many manufacturers and may differ in the type and size of 
syringe that can be used, the position of the control switches and layout of the LED display. The 
user needs to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the device in their department.</p>

<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>

<p><b>All babies who require administration of intravenous fluids, especially for 
maintenance or resuscitation will need a syringe driver to deliver the fluids.</b></p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Patients who are not being fed are at risk of developing hypoglycaemia and 
dehydration. Syringe drivers are used for the controlled infusion of small volumes 
of intravenous fluids over minutes or hours.</b></p>

<p>A syringe driver uses an internal motor to push a syringe plunger at very slow rates to 
ensure controlled delivery of low volumes of fluid. Syringe drivers may be calibrated for 
specific syringe brands and sizes and may have internal medicine libraries that can store 
flow rates and delivery volumes for specific types of fluids.</p>

<p><em>Normal standards related to care</em></p>

<p>Patients should receive intravenous fluid per hour, based on their weight and age.<b> Due 
to their small weights, neonates should never be given fluid too quickly or in too 
large volumes.</b></p>

<h2 id="Management">Management</h2>

<p><b>Management of a syringe pump covers how to use the device in a variety of 
settings, including set up for a patient, patient preparation & commencement, care 
whilst on the device & removal of the patient from the device.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">SETTING UP FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Collect:</li>
<ul>
<li> Syringe driver</li>
<li> Power cable</li>
<li> Clearly labelled syringe of treatment fluid</li>
<li> Extension tubing</li>
</ul>
<li> Connect the power cable to the syringe driver. Plug into socket and turn on socket. </li>
<li> Place the syringe in the syringe channel. Secure with the syringe clamp. Move the syringe 
pusher to the top of the syringe plunger.</li>
<li> Turn on the syringe driver. Set the desired flow rate and volume on the syringe driver. 
Press start.</li>
<li> Check that fluid is coming out of the tip of the syringe. Connect extension tubing to the 
end of the syringe and allow fluid to flush through the extension tubing. Ensure fluid is 
coming from the end of the extension tube and that there are no air bubbles in the system.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">PREPARING A PATIENT</h3>

<p><b>If the patient is cannulated:</b></p>

<ol>
<li> Collect:</li> 
<ul>
<li> Gloves</li>
<li> 70% alcohol</li>
<li> Cotton swab</li>
<li> Labelled syringe of normal saline</li>
</ul>
<li> Wash hands and put on gloves.</li> 
<li> Clean end of cannula using cotton swabs soaked in 70% alcohol.</li>
<li> Flush cannula with 1 ml normal saline .If the site provides pressure as it is flushed or if the 
skin around the site becomes puffy, the line may not have been placed correctly. Reassess 
or replace line.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>If the patient is not cannulated:</b></p>

<ol>
<li> Collect:</li>
 
<ul>
<li> Gloves</li>
<li> Gauze or cotton swabs</li>
<li> 70% alcohol</li>
<li> Intravenous cannula (24 gauge)</li>
<li> Tape</li>
<li> Syringe of normal saline</li></ul>
<li>Wash hands and put on gloves.</li>
<li>Clean patient’s arm using cotton swabs or gauze soaked in alcohol. Grip patient’s
arm, to create a gentle tourniquet. Never use an elastic band or thin gloved sleeve
to create a neonatal tourniquet. Insert intravenous cannula into vein. Wait for flash
of blood.</li>
<li>Continue inserting cannula while gently pulling needle out of the patient’s arm.
Blood should continue coming out of the cannula.</li>
<li> Flush cannula with 1 ml normal saline. If the site provides pressure as it is flushed 
or if the skin around the site becomes puffy, the line may not have been placed 
correctly. Reassess or replace line.</li>
<li> If the cannula flushes correctly, cap cannula.</li> 
<li> Tape the cannula in place using tape to ensure it is secure. View of the cannula 
should not be obstructed. Never encircle the limb with tape as this can cause 
vascular compromise.</li> 
<li> Apply a splint if needed to prevent occlusion of the extension tubing</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="start" div style="background-color:lightblue">STARTING A PATIENT</h3>


<ol>
<li> Check that the extension tubing is full of fluid. <b>There should be NO AIR GOING 
INTO THE CANNULA.</b>
<li> Set syringe driver to appropriate rate and delivery volume. Wait until a drop of fluid 
forms on the end of the extension tubing. </li>
<li> Attach the tubing to the cannula. </li>
<li> After 30 minutes, assess the cannula site for redness, swelling or cannula 
displacement. If the site is puffy, the fluid is not running or the syringe driver is 
alarming:
<ul>
<li> Stop the syringe driver.</li>
<li> Flush the cannula to assess patency. If not patent, remove cannula and 
replace on a different extremity</li>
</ul></ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">CARING FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<p>As a minimum the patient should be assessed no less frequently than 4 hourly for:</p>
<ol>
<li> Any puffiness or redness around the cannula site</li>
<li> Cannula displacement</li>
<li> Vital signs, including respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation and 
temperature</li>
<li> Fluid balance using input/output charts
<li> Blood sugar</li>
</ol>
<p>The time of the treatment should be carefully recorded. The syringe driver should be monitored 
frequently to check:</p>
<ol>
<li> Remaining syringe fluid volume </li>
<li> Any alarms, including occlusions or similar</li>
</ol>

<p><em>If the syringe volume finishes and the patient requires additional fluids, repeat the process 
for <a href="#start">Starting</a> a patient on a syringe driver.</em></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">REMOVING A PATIENT</h3>

<p>If the delivery of fluids is complete and the patient does not require more fluid, press Stop 
on the syringe driver. Remove the extension tubing and cap the cannula.</p>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent 
hospital-acquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not 
disinfected or reprocessed promptly or adequately between patients, they may 
pose a significant infection risk.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>
<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or alcohol before and after assessing a patient 
for commencement on a syringe driver or handling any materials that will be used 
on a patient (e.g. an intravenous catheter). <b>Gloves should be worn throughout 
the process of inserting or adjusting a catheter and disposed of immediately 
after concluding the procedure.</b></li>
<li> Always thoroughly clean the patient’s skin before inserting or adjusting a cannula. 
Inadequate cleaning of the skin may result in an infection. </li>
<li> Ensure that all patient-related consumables (including syringes, extension tubing 
and intravenous cannulas) are new before use. Materials used in intravenous 
delivery that have come in contact with biofluids <b>may never be reused for 
multiple patients.</b></li>
<li> All patient-related consumables should be stored in a clean, dry location.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Turn off and unplug the syringe driver. </li>
<li> Dispose of the tubing and syringe in hazardous waste container or bin. Clean the 
LCD controls and syringe clamp with a cotton swab soaked in alcohol after every 
use.</li>
<li> Housing of the syringe driver should be cleaned according to ward guidelines for 
disinfecting surfaces.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Infection: </b>inadequate cleaning of the skin prior to cannula insertion, use of a longterm indwelling cannula and contamination of the extension tubing or syringe are 
all risks for infection.</li>
<li> <b>Extravasation injury:</b> if the cannula stops working or becomes displaced but fluid 
administration continues, there is risk of an extravasation injury which may cause 
damage to the surrounding skin, tissues, muscles and nerves. <b>It is important to 
frequently reassess the cannula site and respond to syringe driver alarms to 
prevent this.</b></li> 
<li> <b>Fluid overload:</b> delivery of intravenous fluid at too fast a rate or in too large a 
volume may result in fluid overload leading to oedema or respiratory distress. </li>
<li> <b>Dehydration and hypoglycaemia:</b> if the cannula is displaced or stops working, 
the tubing is occluded or the syringe driver malfunctions, delivery of fluid may 
become obstructed. This can result in dehydration or hypoglycaemia. </li>
<li> <b>Air emboli:</b> if there is air in the syringe or the tubing an air embolus may occur.
Severe air emboli can cause respiratory difficulties, heart failure or death.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<p><b>Errors related to syringe type:</b> may cause inaccurate volumes of fluid to be delivered 
due to calibration for a specific brand of syringe.</p>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime. </b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>Usually mains-powered with a rechargeable battery. A syringe driver should be taken off 
its charger only as necessary to ensure that it is charged for use in the event of a power 
blackout</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>Syringe drivers may be mounted on a wall or pole for easy access. Multiple syringe drivers 
may be used on a single patient at once. Care should be taken to ensure the syringe 
drivers are secured in place while in use and syringes are clearly labelled by content.</p>

<h3 id="preventive" div style="background-color:lightblue">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>The syringe driver should be set up as if to prepare for a patient and allowed to run for 15 
minutes a week if not in use. Visually inspect the syringe driver for any missing parts or 
alarms during this testing period.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Repair</h2>

<p><b>Although users are not responsible for repairing their devices, there are steps that 
may be taken to troubleshoot first-line errors that may occur before contacting 
maintenance or engineering support. </b></p>
