<h2>Why is care of the low birth weight infant so important in Malawi?</h2>

<p>In 2018, WHO estimated that 10.5% of babies in Malawi are born with low birth weight of 
whom the majority are premature; therefore all health care providers must be familiar with the 
care of this group of infants.</p>


<p>A neonate who weighs less than 2500g is a low birth weight baby. Nearly 75% of neonatal 
deaths occur among low birth weight neonates. Even after recovering from neonatal
complications, some LBW babies remain more prone to malnutrition, recurrent infections, and
neurodevelopmental handicaps.</p>

<p>Infants with LBW may be small due to either prematurity or intra-uterine growth retardation 
(IUGR). IUGR results in a baby who is small for gestational age (SGA). It is helpful to try and 
decide if the aby is premature or SGA, as the management is slightly different. SGA babies 
are symmetrically small.</p>

<p>Remember, they could also be both premature and SGA. There are maturity charts or scoring 
systems that can help to decide the <a href="#gestation">gestation age</a> of a baby.

<h3 id="gestation">How to estimate the gestational age:</h3>

<p>Often the gestational age of newborns is not clear and approximations have to be made. The 
most accurate way to do this is to use a maturity chart. Approximate gestational age can be 
estimated by adding the scores of the following features shown below 
[Parkin Score (<a class="seealso" href="bibl.html">2</a>)].</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Management at Delivery of Low Birth Weight/Premature Babies</h2>

<p>The delivery of an expected LBW baby should be in hospital. Premature labour as well as
intrauterine growthretardation is anindication to refer a pregnant woman to hospital before the
baby is born (in-utero transfer).</p>

<h3>Deciding where a LBW baby should be managed:</h3>

<p>The mother and the family under the supervision of a health care worker can manage an 
otherwise healthy LBW newborn with a birth weight of 1500 grams or above at home.</p>

<p>Infants below this weight are at risk of hypothermia, feeding problems, apnoea, respiratory 
distress syndrome, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The risks associated with keeping the child 
in hospital (e.g., hospital-acquired infections) should be balanced against the potential benefit 
of better monitoring and care, such as reviewing the infants at least twice a day to assess 
feeding ability, fluid intake or the presence of any danger signs. The risk of hospital-acquired 
infection can be reduced by keeping the mother and baby together and using 
<a href="#KMC">Kangaroo Mother Care.</a>
</p>

<h3>The indications for hospitalisation of a LBW neonate include the following:</h3>

<ul>
<li> A sick neonate with <a class="seealso" href="C2_Routine Care.html#Danger">danger signs.</a></li>
<li> A LBW neonate who is not gaining weight.</li>
<li> Neonate who is unable to feed from the breast or by cup.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="KMC">Keeping the LBW babies dry and warm (prevention of hypothermia)</h3>

<p>The definition of Continuous Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is care of a preterm infant carried 
skin-to-skin with the mother. Its key features include early, continuous, and prolonged skin-toskin contact between the mother and the baby, and exclusive breastfeeding (ideally) or feeding 
with breast milk. Mortality, hypothermia, rates of infection, and readmission are lower in 
neonates nursed in continuous KMC when compared with conventional care. Weight gain will 
be faster with KMC compared to conventional care. All newborns weighing 2000 g or less at 
birth should be provided with as much continuous KMC as possible.</p>

<p><em>Intermittent </em>KMC is the practice of skin-to-skin care alternated with the use of a warming crib,
radiant warmer, or an incubator care for the baby. Intermittent KMC is associated with reduced 
rates of hypothermia and infection compared to conventional care.</p>

<p><b>In Malawi, there are three categories of KMC:</b></p>

<ol>
<li><b> Facility KMC </b>– recommended for all neonates with a birth weight of < 1500 grams.</li>
<li><b> Ambulatory KMC</b> – babies weighing 1500 – 1800 grams after discharge from a facility 
but who continue to be followed up by that facility.</li>
<li><b> Community KMC</b> – babies > 1800 grams and clinically stable who are cared for in the 
community.</li>
</ol>

<p>If neither continuous nor intermittent KMC is possible then an overhead radiant warmer, 
incubator, or warming crib may be used to keep the baby warm. The room where a LBW baby 
is nursed should be kept warm (25<sup>o</sup>C). The baby should wear a hat to cover the head. Wet 
clothing should be changed frequently to keep the baby warm and dry. Regular monitoring of 
axillary temperature should be done. </p>

<td class="yellowframe" >
<p>If there are no signs of distress, a mother can provide a warm environment with 
<q>Kangaroo care</q> for the baby at home or hospital. Place the baby, with a nappy, 
socks and hat, upright inside mothers’ clothing against mother’s bare skin between 
her breasts, with the infant’s head turned to one side. Tie the infant to the mother 
with a cloth and cover the mother and infant with the mother’s clothes. Twins can 
practice KMC together on the mother’s chest.</p>

<p>Let the baby suckle at the breast as often as s/he wants, but at least every 2 hours. 
Mother should sleep propped up so that the baby stays upright. If environmental 
temperature is low add a blanket to mother’s wrap. When mother wants to bathe or 
rest, ask the father or another family member to ‘Kangaroo’ the baby or wrap the 
infant in several layers of warm clothing, covered with blankets, and keep in a warm 
place. If the feet of the baby feel cold, s/he requires extra warmth.</p>

<h2 id="feeds" style="color:blue;">Feeding the LBW Infant:</h2>

<p>Breast milk is the preferred milk because it has a high electrolyte and protein content 
necessary for rapid growth of the baby. The antibodies and other anti-infective factors in 
mother’s milk are very necessary for the survival of a preterm baby.</p>

<p>Birth weight, gestation, presence or absence of sickness, and individual feeding efforts of the 
baby determine the decision as to how a LBW neonate should receive fluids and nutrition. The 
gestational age is one of the most important determinants, as coordinated sucking and 
swallowing does not develop until about 34 week’s gestation.</p>

<p>Those unable to feed directly on the breast, but who are clinically stable, can be given 
expressed breast milk (EBM) by oro-gastric tube or cup feeds. The mother should express her 
own milk into a clean container. In order to promote lactation, and enable the baby to learn to 
suck, all babies more than 1500 grams and 32 weeks of gestation should be put on the breast 
for 5-10 minutes before <a href="#cup">cup</a> or tube feeding.</p>

<p><b>Is the baby able to breastfeed effectively?</b></p>

<p>When offered the breast, the baby roots, attaches well and sucks effectively.
S/he is able to suck long enough to satisfy needs.</p>

<p><b>Is the baby able to accept feeds by alternative methods?</b></p>

<p>When offered <a href="#cup">cup</a> feeds, the baby opens the mouth, takes milk, and swallows without 
coughing or spluttering.<br />
S/he is able to take an adequate quantity to satisfy needs.</p>

<p><b>Is the baby getting enough breastmilk?</b></p>

<p>The best way to find out is to see how fast the baby grows over a few days. Babies need 
different amounts of breast milk to grow at the same rate. Too fast growth and too slow growth 
can cause health problems. The key measure of optimal feeding is the weight pattern of the 
baby. The ideal weight gain is similar to the average weight that a foetus gains in the uterus, 
about 15-20g/kg/day.</p>

<h3>Judging adequacy of nutrition:</h3>

<p>If nutrition supply of the baby is found to be inadequate due to reduced milk supply of the 
mother, there are several ways to increase the milk production:</p>

<ul>
<li> Increase the rate of breastfeeding/expression of both breasts to at least three hourly 
even at night and ensure both breasts are emptied completely on each occasion.</li>
<li> Increase the intake of nutritious food and increase the amount of liquids of the mother.</li>
<li> Ask the mother to rest sufficiently.</li>
<li> Treat any underlying illness in the mother.</li>

Breast Milk Expression</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="yellowframe"><b>It is useful for all mothers to know how to express their milk. Expression of 
breast milk is required in the following situations:</b>

<ul>
<li> To maintain milk production and for feeding the baby who is premature, low
birth weight or sick and cannot breast feed for some time.</li>
<li> To relieve breast problems e.g., engorgement.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Technique of expression – teach mother to:</b></p>

<ul>
<li> Wash her hands with soap and water thoroughly before expression. Sit or
stand comfortably and hold the clean container near her breast.</li>
<li> Put a thumb on her breast above the nipple and areola, and her first finger
on the breast below the nipple and areola, opposite the thumb. She supports
the breast with her other fingers.</li>
<li> Press her thumb and first finger slightly inwards towards the chest wall.</li>
<li> Press her breast behind the nipple and areola between her fingers and
thumb. She must press on the lactiferous sinuses beneath the areola.
Sometimes in a lactating breast it is possible to feel the sinuses. They feel
like soft peanuts.</li>
<li> If she can feel them, she can press on them. Press and release, press and
release.</li>
<li> This should not hurt – if it hurts the technique is wrong. At first no milk may
come, but after pressing a few times, milk starts to drip out.</li>
<li> Press the areola in the same way from the sides, to make sure that milk is
expressed from all segments of the breast.</li>
<li> Avoid rubbing or sliding her fingers along the skin. The movements of the
fingers should be more like rolling.</li>
<li> Avoid squeezing the nipple itself. Pressing or pulling the nipple cannot
express milk.</li>
<li> Express one breast for at least 3-5 minutes until the flow slows; then express
the other side; and then repeat both sides. She can use either hand for either
breast.</li>
<li> Explain that to express breast milk adequately may take 20-30 minutes.
Having the baby close or handling the baby before milk expression may help
the mother to have a good let-down reflex. It is important not to try to express
in a shorter time. To stimulate and maintain milk production she should
express milk frequently – at least 8 times in 24 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tube feeding">Nasogastric tube feeding (NG tube)</h3>

<p>Insertion of a nasogastric tube: The catheter is measured from the tip of the nose to the ear 
lobe and then to the midpoint between the xiphoid and umbilicus. Mark the position on the 
tube with a piece of tape. This length of the tube should be inserted through the nose. For 
tube feeding, use French size 5 or 6 nasogastric tubes.</p>

<p><b>Oro-gastric tube feeding (OG tube) and naso-gastric tube feeding (NGT)</b><p>

<p>Insertion of an oro-gastric tube: measure the distance between angle of mouth to earlobe, and 
then to the midpoint between the xiphoid and umbilicus. Mark the position on the tube with a 
piece of tape. This is the length of tube that is inserted.</p>

<p>During nasogastric or oro-gastric insertion, the head is slightly raised and a wet (not lubricated) 
catheter is gently passed through the nose (nasogastric) or mouth (oro-gastric) down through 
the oesophagus to the stomach. Its position is verified by aspirating the gastric contents and 
auscultating over the epigastric region. Injecting air into the tube can be dangerous.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin103.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin103.png" max-width="100%"/></a>

<p>At the time of feeding, the outer end of the tube is attached to a 10/20ml syringe (without 
plunger) and milk is allowed to trickle by gravity. There is no need to burp a tube-fed baby.</p>

<p>The nasogastric or oro-gastric tube should be left in situ for up to three (3) days.</p> 

<p>While pulling out a feeding tube, it must be kept pinched and pulled out gently.</p> 

<p>Tube feeding may be risky in very small babies. They have small stomach capacity and the 
gut may not be ready to tolerate feeds. Stasis may also result from paralytic ileus due to 
several conditions. Thus, tube-fed babies are candidates for regurgitation and aspiration. It is 
important therefore to take precautions.</p>

<p>Before the next feed, aspirate the stomach, if the aspirate is more than 25 percent of the last feed, 
the baby should be evaluated for any illness. The feeds may have to be decreased in volume 
or stopped and replaced with IV fluids.</p>

<h3>Steps of oro-/nasogastric tube feeding</h3>

<ol>
<li> Before starting a feed, check the position of the tube.</li>
<li> For each feed take a clean syringe and remove the plunger.</li>
<li> Pinch the tube and connect the barrel of the syringe to the end of the gastric tube.</li>
<li> Pinch the tube and fill the barrel of the syringe with the required volume of milk.</li>
<li> Hold the tube with one hand, release the pinch and elevate the syringe to 5-10 cm 
above the level of the baby.</li>
<li> Let the milk run from the syringe through the gastric tube by gravity.</li>
<li> Do not force milk through the gastric tube by using the plunger of the syringe.</li>
<li> The milk should flow slowly into the baby’s stomach: control the flow by altering the
height of the syringe; lowering the syringe slows the milk flow, raising the syringe makes
the milk flow faster</li>
<li> Observe the baby during the entire gastric tube feed. Do not leave the baby
unattended.</li>
<li> Avoid flushing the tube with water or saline after giving feeds.</li>
<li> Keep the gastric tube capped between feeds.</li>
<li> Progress to feeding by cup/spoon when the baby can swallow without coughing or
spitting milk. This could be possible in as little as one or two days, or it may take longer
than one week.</li>
<li> Replace the gastric tube with another clean gastric tube after 3 days, or earlierif it is
pulled out or becomes blocked.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps of <b id="cup">cup feeding</b></h3>

<p>Baby should be awake and held sitting semi-upright on caregiver’s lap. Put a small cloth on the 
front of chest to catch drips of milk.</p>

<ol>
<li> Put a measured amount of milk in the cup.</li>
<li> Hold the cup so that the more pointed tip rests on the baby’s lowerlip.</li>
<li> Tip the cup to pour a small amount of milk at a time into the baby’s mouth.</li>
<li> Feed the baby slowly.</li>
<li> Make sure that the baby has swallowed the milk already taken before giving anymore.</li>
<li> When the baby has had enough, he or she will close her mouth and will not take</li>
anymore. Do not force the baby to feed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Document the time and amount of feed that the baby received.</p>
