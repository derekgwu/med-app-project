<h2 id="Breathing difficulties" style="color:blue;">Breathing Difficulties in the Newborn</h2>

<p><b>Why are breathing difficulties in the newborn so important?</b><br />

Breathing difficulties are the most common way that sick neonates present to the healthcare 
worker. There are several different possible diagnoses and these need to be considered in order 
to provide the correct management.</p>


<p><b>Newborns at Risk of Developing Breathing Problems</b></p>

<ul>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C9_Preterm.html">Preterm</a> infants</li>
<li> Infants born to mothers with fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, foul-smelling 
amniotic fluid</li>

<h3 id="management" style="color:blue;">Management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)</h3>

<ul>
<li> Clear airway if necessary.</li>
<li> Put the baby in neutral (sniffing) position.</li>
<li> Give <a href="#oxygen">oxygen</a> via nasal cannula 0.5-1 litre per minute(escalate as needed, but consider early 
<a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html"> CPAP </a>).</li>
<li> Give  <a class="seealso" href="Formulary.html">antibiotics </a> if persistent respiratory distress after 4 hours of age or if the working
diagnosis includes  <a class="seealso" href="C15_Sepsis.html">sepsis </a>, pneumonia, or meconium aspiration syndrome.</li>
<li> Position with the thorax 30 degrees upright to ease the breathing.</li>
<li> Treat the underlying cause if identified</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider CPAP early if the newborn condition does not improve from severe respiratory distress 
 <a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html"> CPAP </a>. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is recommended for the treatment 
of preterm newborns with RDS and should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made (<a class="seealso" href="bibl.html">5</a>).</p>


<h3 id="apnoea" style="color:blue;">Apnoea</h3>

<p>Definition: cessation of breathing for longer than 20 seconds which may be associated with 
bradycardia. It may be due to prematurity or secondary to other conditions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li> Respiratory distress</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C15_Sepsis.html">Infections</a></li>
<li> Cold-stressed babies who are being warmed</li>
<li> Low blood volume or low haematocrit</li>
<li> Low blood glucose</li>
<li> CNS disorders</li>
<li> Perinatal compromise</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C9_Preterm.html">Prematurity</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Investigations <br/>– AFTER clinical examination:</b></p>

<ul>
<li> Blood sugar </li>
<li> Temperature </li>
<li> Packed cell volume</li>
<li> Sepsis work-up (blood culture, urine dipstick and culture, LP, CXR, FBCs, Urea, creatinine 
and electrolytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the possibility that the baby could be having a 
<a class="seealso" href="C16_ComaConvulsions.html">seizure</a></p>
<p>If a portable ultrasound is available, perform a cranial ultrasound to look for intracranial bleeds.</p>
</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b></p>

<p>Determine cause and treat.</br />
General measures: tactile stimulation, correct anaemia, maintain normal body temperature, look 
for electrolyte imbalance, intraventricular haemorrhage, signs or symptoms of sepsis, patent 
ductus arteriosus, necrotising enterocolitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and treat accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Give aminophylline for prevention of apnoea of prematurity.</b></p>

<p>Aminophylline doses: 6 mg/kg PO stat loading dose followed by 2.5mg/kg BD (twice daily) PO.
Dissolve aminophylline 100 mg tablets in 20 mls of water; each ml of solution then contains 5 mg
of aminophylline.
See for preparation and dosing <a class='seealso' href="WD_Antibiotic and Aminophylline doses.html#amino">Wall chart Aminophylline doses</a> for the doses of oral aminophylline when using a solution made from atablet.</p>

<p><b><em>When to start  <a class="seealso" href="Formulary.html"> aminophylline: </a></b></em></p>

<p>About 25% of neonates &lt;34 weeks have apnoea of prematurity. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
start aminophylline prophylactically to all premature infants of gestational age &lt; 34 weeks or 
weight &lt;1800 grams.</p>

<p><b><em>When to stop aminophylline:</b></em></p>

<p>If the baby is symptomatic (having episodes of apnoea) start aminophylline immediately and stop 
when the patient has had 2 weeks with no apnoea episodes and is &gt;35 weeks or &gt;1800g. Observe 
for a further 7 days in hospital.</p>

<p>If the baby is asymptomatic (having no apnoea episodes) but is &lt;35 weeks or &lt;1800 g then start 
aminophylline. Stop when &gt;35 weeks or &gt;1800grams. Observe for a further 7 days in hospital.</p>

<p>If caffeine is available this would be the first choice over aminophylline.</p>

<p><b id="equipment">Equipment for Management of a Baby with Breathing Problems</b></p>

<p>Essential equipment required to effectively manage a baby with breathing difficulties are listed 
below and will be discussed individually.</p>

<li> <a class="seealso" href="E5_Oxygen splitter.html">Oxygen splitter</a></li></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="YI" style="color:blue;">Breathing Difficulties in the Young Infant</h3></h3>

<p>YIs with breathing difficulties present with fast breathing and difficulties with feeding. On 
examination there may be grunting, head nodding, cyanosis, intercostal, sternal and subcostal 
recession. On auscultation there may be crepitations or/and wheezes.</p>

<p>The main differential diagnoses in this age group are:</p>
<ul>
<li> Pneumonia</li>
<li> Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), if exposed to 
<a class="seealso" href="C2_Routine Care.html#HIV">HIV</a></li>
<li> Bronchiolitis</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C2_Routine Care.html#Tuberculosis">TB</a></li>
<li> Congenital Heart Disease</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Supportive Treatment – Nutrition</b></p>

<p>If the baby is breathing &lt; 60 bpm, breastfeeding may be tried. If the baby is struggling to feed, 
changeto oro- or nasogastric tube feeds.</p>

<p>If the baby is breathing fast (e.g. 60-80 bpm), 
<a class="seealso" href="WC_Maintenance Oral and IV fluids.html">feed </a>by oro- or nasogastric tube every two hours 
with expressed breast milk (i.e., restricted maintenance volumes).<p>
<p>If the baby is breathing very fast &gt; 80 bpm, consider 
<a class="seealso" href="WC_Maintenance Oral and IV fluids.html#fluids">IV fluids</a> (100 mls/kg/day).</p>

<p><b id="oxygen">Oxygen Therapy </b>– Escalate Stepwise</b></p>

<p>Before oxygen administration, ensure that the airway is clear. Then administer oxygen via nasal 
prongs or nasal catheter, start with 0.5 litres/minute. Assess after 15-30 minutes, if oxygen 
saturations remain &lt;90%, escalate O2 quickly to 1 litre/minute with a maximum of 2 litres/minute. 
Reassess after 30 minutes and if the O2 saturation is still below 90%, administer O2 at 4
litres/minute through face mask.<p>

<p>Consider <a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html">CPAP</a> if there is no improvement on oxygen therapy and there are no contraindications.</p>
<br />

<p><b>Specific Treatment</b></p>

<p>Treat with IV antibiotics if pneumonia is suspected (cough, fever or crepitations on examination) 
– see <a class='seealso' href="WD_Antibiotic and Aminophylline doses.html">wall charts</a> for doses.<p>

<p>Give high dose cotrimoxazole and steroids if PJP is suspected, – see <a class='seealso' href="Formulary.html">formulary</a> for doses.</p>

<h2>E 2 Pulse oximeter</h2>
Pulse oximeters should also be used during treatment for all sick or at-risk patients, or
those being treated with oxygen therapy, CPAP, or any form of assisted ventilation.
See <a class="seealso" href="E2_Pulse oximeter.html">pulse oximeter</a> for more information. 
 
<h2>E 3 Oxygen Concentrator</h2>
An oxygen concentrator is used on its own when oxygen needs to be delivered to
one or two patients. Concentrators may also be used to share oxygen between
multiple patients using a flow splitter or used with other treatment devices such as
continuous positive airway pressure devices.
Supplemental oxygen is indicated for sick children, especially those with hypoxia
(SpO2 &lt; 90%) which has many clinical causes.<br/>
See <a class="seealso" href="E3_Oxygen concentrator.html">oxygen concentrator</a> for more information. 

<h2>E 4 Oxygen Cylinder</h2>
Oxygen cylinders may be used to provide supplemental oxygen directly to hypoxic
patients, to be shared between patients using a flow splitter or used with other
treatment devices such as continuous positive airway pressure devices.
See <a class="seealso" href="E4_Oxygen cylinder.html">oxygen cylinder</a> for more information. 

<h2>E 5 Oxygen Splitter</h2>
Flow splitters are used when oxygen from one source needs to be delivered to
more than one hypoxic patient at low flows.
See <a class="seealso" href="E5_Oxygen splitter.html">oxygen splitter</a> for more information.
