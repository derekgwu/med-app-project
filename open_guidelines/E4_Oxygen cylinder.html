<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>

<p><b>Oxygen cylinders may be used to provide supplemental oxygen directly to hypoxic
patients, to be shared between patients using a flow splitter or used with other
treatment devices such as continuous positive airway pressure devices.</b>
</p>

<p>Possible causes of hypoxia are outlined in <b><a class="seealso" href="C6_oxygen.html">Oxygen Therapy</a>: Clinical Problem.</b></p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Hypoxia contributes to both morbidity and mortality. Oxygen cylinders (2.1) deliver 
oxygen concentration of up to 99.5% and may be used as backup to oxygen 
concentrators in case of power outage or as a primary source of oxygen, 
particularly in a walled oxygen system.</b></p>

<p>Oxygen cylinders are usually made of a steel or aluminium alloy and are distinguished 
from other cylinders by having a black body with white shoulders and top. The capacity 
of oxygen is rated in litres which indicates the amount of oxygen the tank can store. 
Cylinder sizing follows an alphabetical system. Each letter corresponds to the capacity in 
litres of that particular cylinder.</p>

<p>Unlike oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders do not concentrate their own oxygen from 
ambient air, they are durable storage vessels for oxygen. Cylinders must be filled with 
oxygen under high pressure. At the oxygen generation plant, the oxygen cylinder is filled 
with oxygen up to a pressure of about 137-200 bar. Once a cylinder’s stop valve is in an 
open position, the pressure in the cylinder pushes the oxygen out. It passes through the 
stop valve to the pressure gauge and then the flow regulator. From the flow regulator the 
oxygen can then be delivered to a patient through a flow splitter, CPAP, or other oxygen 
delivery device. Oxygen cylinders are especially useful when high flow oxygen is required 
or as back up to concentrators when the power source fails.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin51.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin51.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Since neonates require <b>low flows, </b>flow meters with precision of at least 0.1 L/min should 
be utilised. There are special ultra-low flowmeters available for use with neonates with 
precision adjustments of 0.02-0.03 L/min which, especially in settings which do not utilise 
blenders, can be particularly useful to provide necessary oxygen to neonates and 
minimising hyperoxia. However, ultra-low flowmeters are not always available and great 
care must be taken when adjusting the oxygen flow through a standard flowmeter to 
monitor saturations and avoid hyperoxia which does not allow for very low flow titrations.</p>

<p>Neonatal patients should reach SpO<sub>2</sub> levels of 90 – 95% by 15 minutes after birth. (Alert 
2.1)<sup>1,3–6</sup>. If oxygen is needed it is recommended to give between 0.5-1 L/min.<sup>2</sup> Whilst on 
oxygen, regular monitoring should be conducted using a pulse oximeter to ensure that 
this saturation range is maintained for the duration of treatment. Ideally, patients suffering 
from severe respiratory distress should have continuous pulse oximetry monitoring 
throughout care.<sup>2</sup></p>

<td>  When making this recommendation the following resources were
considered:
<ol>
<li>According to the Textbook of Neonatal Resuscitation (NRP), 7th 
Ed., “After birth, the oxygen saturation gradually increases above 
90%. However, even healthy term newborns may take 10 minutes 
or longer to reach this saturation” (p.77).<sup>1</sup></li>
<li> Target peripheral oxygen concentrations (SpO2) for newborns vary 
depending on age and clinical condition. However, most authorities 
agree that saturations between 90-95% minimises the 
complications associated with both low and high oxygen levels 
including death, neurodevelopmental impairment and Retinopathy
of Prematurity.<sup>3-6</sup></li></ol>

<h2 id="Management">Management</h2>

<p><b>Management of an oxygen concentrator covers how to use the device in a variety 
of settings, including set up for a patient, patient preparation & commencement, 
care whilst on the device & removal of the patient from the device.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">SETTING UP FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or 70% alcohol before and after placing a patient 
on oxygen or handling any tubing that will be used on a patient. </li>
<li> Make sure the oxygen cylinder is in an upright position and is secured to a wall or 
stable object. </li>
<li> Assemble the pressure regulator and the flowmeter and connect them to the 
cylinder using the pin index connector. The flowmeter must be upright (vertical to 
the floor) to be read correctly. Tighten all connections and make sure there are no 
leaks.</li>
<li> Open the on/off valve and the pressure regulator assembly. Check the amount of 
oxygen in the cylinder by reading the pressure gauge. </li>
<li> Connect the oxygen delivery device. Adjust the flowrate required with the 
flowmeter regulator. </li>
<li> Assess whether your patient requires humidified flow. If oxygen needs are greater 
than 4 L/min, connect a humidifier.<sup>2,11</sup></li>
<li> Test that oxygen flow has begun by listening for a hissing sound at the patient end 
of the delivery device (e.g., nasal prongs). This can also be tested by submerging 
the nasal prongs in clean water and checking for bubbles <b>(3.4),</b> also known as the 
<q>Bubble Test</q>.<sup>11</sup></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">REMOVING A PATIENT</h3>

<p>Once patients are clinically ready to be removed from the oxygen cylinder therapy as 
defined in <a class="seealso" href="C6_oxygen.html">Oxygen Therapy</a><b>: Assessment,</b> 
follow steps to remove the patient from oxygen. Close the flowmeter on the cylinder.</p>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospitalacquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not 
disinfected or reprocessed promptly or adequately between patients, they may 
pose a significant infection risk.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or 70% alcohol before and after placing a patient 
on oxygen or handling any tubing that will be used on a patient.</li>
<li> The housing of the oxygen cylinder should be cleaned according to ward 
guidelines for disinfecting surfaces, or by wiping down with soapy water.</li>
<li> Ensure the stop valve is tightly shut in between patients and whist being stored.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Close the flowmeter on the cylinder. If reusing tubing, immediately remove and 
begin hospital protocol for disinfection as outlined in 
<a class="seealso" href="C6_oxygen.html">Oxygen Therapy</a><b>: Infection 
Prevention.</b></li>
<li> Clean the flowmeter, gauge and dials using 70% alcohol after every use. </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>
<p><b>Irresponsible use of high pressurised oxygen cylinders could easily result in a
disaster, serious injury or death for patients or staff on the ward. Strict adherence
to safety protocol, maintenance and proper use is critical when using oxygen
cylinders.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Fire:</b> oxygen is an agent of combustion, meaning fire will burn more readily in its presence.
Never use grease or oil to lubricate parts of the oxygen cylinder.</li>
<li><b>Pressurised gas:</b> oxygen cylinders are filled at very high pressures and must be chained
to secure in place. Accidently tipping over a high-pressurised oxygen cylinder can easily
dislodge the cap, creating a high-speed projectile. This projectile moves with sufficient
speed and strength to break through cement walls. This poses an extreme danger to
surrounding patients, health staff and hospital infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Cylinder empty:</b> the stop valve on the cylinder must be turned off tightly when the cylinder
is not in use. It is not uncommon for the valve to be left partially open and the cylinder will
slowly empty.</li>
<li><b>Cylinder unstable:</b> the cylinder is very heavy and if not secured in an upright position can 
fall over and cause serious injury to a baby or member of staff. If it falls the flowmeter or 
pressure gauge may also be damaged.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime. </b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>Not powered.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>Oxygen cylinders should always be kept well-secured and safe from tipping or dropping, 
ideally along a wall with securing chains anchored into the wall. <b>Oxygen cylinders 
should not be placed precariously, tilted or located without securing chains in the 
middle of walking areas.</b></p>

<p>Store in well ventilated, clean and dry conditions. Oxygen cylinders should be well 
labelled and easily distinguishable from other cylinders. Keep away from contaminants 
like oil and grease and sources of heat or ignition. <b>Always use a secure trolley when 
transporting cylinders.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>Set up the oxygen cylinder for use. Open the flow meter & allow the oxygen cylinder to 
release oxygen for 1 minute every week if not in use.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Repair</h2>

<p>Although users are not responsible for repairing their devices, there are steps that 
may be taken to troubleshoot first-line errors that may occur before contacting 
maintenance or engineering support.</p>
