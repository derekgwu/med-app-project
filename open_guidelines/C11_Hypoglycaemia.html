<hr class="yellowline" />

<p>Hypoglycaemia is common in LBW and very sick NYI and should always be considered early in 
management. 20% of infants below seven days of age have hypoglycaemia. It is important to 
identify hypoglycaemia as there is an increased association with convulsions, permanent brain 
injury, and mortality</p>

<p id="define"> COIN defines hypoglycaemia as blood glucose of<b> < 45 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/L)</b> for NYI. Blood glucose 
levels can be checked using a<b> <a class="seealso" href="E9_Glucometer.html">glucometer.</a></b></p>

<p id="risk"><b>Newborns at risk of hypoglycaemia <br/>
Any baby who has:</b></p>

<ul>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C16_ComaConvulsions.html">Seizures</a></li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C16_ComaConvulsions.html">Reduced consciousness</a></li>
<li> Lethargy</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Also:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Small for dates</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C9_Preterm.html">Low birth weight</a></li>
<li> Infant of diabetic mothers</li>
<li> Following <a class="seealso" href="C8_Asphyxia.html">asphyxia</a> 
or prolonged resuscitation</li>
<li> Unable to feed</li>
<li> Jittery babies</li>
</ul>

<h2>E 9 Glucometer</h2>
<p>
Assessment of blood glucose with a glucometer should be conducted as part of
routine assessment for all infants on admission.</p>
<p>Glucometers should also be used during continuing management for all sick or at-risk
patients. Hypoglycaemia may present as:
<ul>
<li>Jitteriness</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Hypotonia</li>
<li>Lethargy</li>
<li>Reduced level of consciousness</li>
<li>Failure to feed or poor feeding</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Hypothermia</li>
<li>Apnoea or irregular breathing</li>
</ul>

<p>Empty fluid out of a litre bag of IV normal saline until there is only 200mls left (4 parts)

<ul>
<li> There have been case reports of dextrose overdose resulting in convulsions and death
(hyperosmolar brain injury).</li>
<li> In newborns it has been suggested that use of 50% glucose increases the risk of 
brain damage due to asphyxia.</li>
<li> 10% glucose solutions work just as well and are safer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maintenance Therapy</h2>

<p>After a bolus of glucose a plan must be made to continue providing a glucose supply as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="seealso" href="WC_Maintenance Oral and IV fluids.html#fluids">IV fluids</a>
with glucose and electrolytes or</li>
<li> Nasal gastric or oral <a class="seealso" href="WC_Maintenance Oral and IV fluids.html#feeds">feed</a
></li>
</ul>

<h2 <h3 style ="color:blue;" id="hyperglycaemia">Hypergylcaemia</h2>

<p>Neonatal hyperglycaemia is defined as a blood glucose of more than 145mg/dl (8mmol/L) 
regardless of body weight, gestational or postnatal age. Hyperglycaemia may be seen in 
any baby but is more common in low birth infants.</p>

<p>In settings where a neonate is on IV fluids the most common cause is infusion of 
inappropriately high amounts of glucose as IV fluids. In our setting, where IV infusions 
are less frequently given, hyperglycaemia is most commonly due to stress, usually from 
an intercurrent sickness such as sepsis, dehydration and HIE. This is because of raised 
cortisol levels in response to the stressful situation. Adequate treatment of the underlying 
illness will often result in resolution of the hyperglycaemia and improvement of babyâ€™s 
overall condition.<b> Rarely</b> patients may have insulin resistance or neonatal insulin 
dependent diabetes mellitus and such patient need discussion and care at a tertiary level 
facility.</p> 

<p><b>What should be done when a neonate has a high glucose reading?</b></p>

<ol>

<li> Repeat the test to confirm if it is accurate (You may want to use a different 
glucometer).</li>
<li> Review the patient fully by performing a physical examination and monitoring their 
vital signs. Often hyperglycaemia is asymptomatic but you may find signs of the 
underlying cause. Also look for signs of dehydration, fever, acidosis and monitor 
the weight. Treat the underlying problem, if identified.</li>
<li> If on IV fluids confirm that the fluids were correctly prepared and administered and
ensure that the infusion rate is appropriate for the age and weight (see infusion
rates on the feeding charts).</li>
<li> If the blood glucose is above 180mg/dl (10mmol/L), this should be discussed with 
a referral facility who will provide additional guidance.</li>
<li> Monitor the baby and the blood sugar 2-4 hourly. </li>
</ol>
