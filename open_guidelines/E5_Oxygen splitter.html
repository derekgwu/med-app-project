<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>

<p><b>Flow splitters are used when oxygen from one source needs to be delivered to 
more than one hypoxic patient at low flows.</b><p>

<p>Possible causes of hypoxia are outlined in <b><a class="seealso" href="C6_oxygen.html">Oxygen Therapy</a>: Clinical Problem.</b></p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Hypoxia contributes to both morbidity and mortality. Flow splitters are accessory 
devices that divide oxygen from one source to give to several patients at 
independent, adjustable flow rates.</b></p>

<p>Flow splitters <b>(2.1) </b>may be used with an oxygen concentrator, oxygen cylinder or walled 
oxygen to provide standard flow supplemental oxygen to patients. Flow splitters may also 
be combined with CPAP if the flowmeter allows the required flow rate. </p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin56.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin56.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>A flow splitter has internal tubing with individual flow regulators that split incoming oxygen 
flow coming from an oxygen source (i.e., oxygen concentrator or cylinder). <b>(2.2)</b> Oxygen 
flow splitters generally provide precise low flow rates, from 0.1 up to a maximum of 2 
L/min from each port. <b>The oxygen concentration delivered through an oxygen flow 
splitter remains unchanged from that of the source.</b></p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin57.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin57.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Neonatal patients should reach SpO<sub>2</sub> levels of 90 – 95% by 15 minutes after birth.<b> (Alert 
2.1)</b><sup>1,3–6</sup>
If oxygen is needed it is recommended to give between 0.5-1 L/min.<sup>2</sup> Whilst on 
oxygen, regular monitoring should be conducted using a pulse oximeter to ensure that 
this saturation range is maintained for the duration of treatment. Ideally, patients suffering 
from severe respiratory distress should have continuous pulse oximetry monitoring 
throughout care.<sup>2</sup></p>

considered:
<ol>
<li>According to the Textbook of Neonatal Resuscitation (NRP), 7th 
Ed., “After birth, the oxygen saturation gradually increases above 
90%. However, even healthy term newborns may take 10 minutes
or longer to reach this saturation” (p.77).<sup>1</sup></li>
<li> Target peripheral oxygen concentrations (SpO2) for newborns vary 
depending on age and clinical condition. However, most authorities 
agree that saturations between 90-95% minimises the 
complications associated with both low and high oxygen levels
including death, neurodevelopmental impairment and Retinopathy 
of Prematurity.<sup>3-6</sup></li></ol>

<h2 id="Management">Management</h2>

<p><b>Management of an oxygen concentrator covers how to use the device in a variety 
of settings, including set up for a patient, patient preparation & commencement, 
care whilst on the device & removal of the patient from the device.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">SETTING UP FOR A PATIENT</h3>
<ol>
<li> Ensure oxygen flow splitter is secured in a location where it cannot be easily 
dislodged and where staff can easily adjust the flowmeter regulators on the splitter. 
<b>(3.1)</b> Make sure flow regulators are open. </li>
<br/>
<a href="../assets/images/coin60.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin60.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin60a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin60a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Connect oxygen splitter tubing from oxygen outlet source to oxygen splitter inlet 
port. <b>(3.2)</b>  </li>
<li> Assess level of oxygen needed from oxygen source. The source of oxygen (e.g., 
the concentrator) must be adjusted to provide a flow of at least 1L/min oxygen 
more than the total requirement from all the ports that are in use. <b>(3.3)</b><br/>
<b>For example:</b> If 2 ports are in use (one port is set at 1L/min, one port is set at 0.5 
L/min) and three ports are shut, the total supply of oxygen required from the 
concentrator is<b> <br/>
2.5 L/min (i.e., 0 + 0.5 + 0 + 1 + 0 (+1 extra L) = 2.5 L/min)</b></li>

<a href="../assets/images/coin61.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin61.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Turn on oxygen at source. The flowmeter beads on the oxygen splitter should pop 
up.</li> 
<li> Adjust each of the port flow meter regulators individually to the required flow rate 
<b>(3.4),</b> observing the L/min at eyelevel.<b> (3.5)</b> The other outlet ports should not 
change as each port is individually adjusted. If being used with an oxygen 
concentrator, some variation may occur cyclically. </li>
<li> Check that the ports have been numbered and number oxygen tubing to prevent 
infants receiving an incorrect flow. When changing flows for one patient, ensure 
that any other patients also on the flow splitter are receiving the correct amounts 
of oxygen.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>
<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospitalacquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not 
disinfected or reprocessed promptly or adequately between patients, they may 
pose a significant infection risk.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>
<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or 70% alcohol before and after placing a patient 
on oxygen or handling any tubing that will be used on a patient.</li>
<li> The housing of the flow splitter should be cleaned according to ward guidelines for 
disinfecting surfaces, or by wiping down with soapy water followed by 70% alcohol. 
Flow splitter oxygen ports should be cleaned using forceps wrapped in gauze and 
soaked in 70% alcohol.</li>
<li> Clean any used equipment that has been in contact with patient or staff.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Turn off the oxygen source. Disconnect oxygen tubing from source and flow 
splitter. If reusing tubing, immediately remove and begin hospital protocol for 
disinfection as outlined in <a class="seealso" href="C6_oxygen.html">Oxygen Therapy</a><b>: Infection 
Prevention.</b></li>
<li> Clean the flow splitter housing and regulators using 70% alcohol 
after every use. </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>
<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximize patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Device positioning:</b> flow splitters are heavy devices and are frequently positioned on
walls or shelves. This is appropriate if well secured. If improperly secured, flow splitters
may fall onto patients, causing potential permanent or fatal injury.</li>
<li><b>Independent flows: </b>flow splitters should be designed to have independent flow
regulation. If the flow splitter is not designed correctly, flows may be dependent: as one
port flow is changed, other port flows may change. These splitters should be exchanged
for one that has independent flow. Even if an independent flow splitter is available, nursery
staff should take care when changing flows for one patient and ensure that any other
patients also on the flow splitter are receiving the correct amounts of oxygen.</li>
<li><b>Flow delivery:</b> staff should always check the oxygen prongs for oxygen flow before
placing patient on machine. If there is no flow, follow steps to troubleshoot in Flow
Splitter: <a href="#Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Repair.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>
<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>Not powered.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>Flow splitters should be mounted and secured in a location where nursing staff can 
regulate and view flows easily, e.g., mounted on a wall with easy and reachable access. 
The splitter should be able to be adjusted at eye level. If possible, the surface on which 
the splitter is mounted should have a raised edge to prevent falls. Tubing can be fixed to 
the wall to distribute oxygen to several cots without the tubing being trailed across the 
floor. It is a good idea to number the ports and the tubing to prevent infants receiving an 
incorrect flow.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>The oxygen flow splitter should be connected to an oxygen source and used for at least 
15 minutes once a week. Each flowmeter dial should be turned on and allowed to flow at 
its max flow for this period of time.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Repair</h2>

<p><b>Although users are not responsible for repairing their devices, there are steps that 
may be taken to troubleshoot first-line errors that may occur before contacting 
maintenance or engineering support. </b></p>
