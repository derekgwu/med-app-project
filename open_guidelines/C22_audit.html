<p>Sustainable development goal 3.2 aims to reduce preventable neonatal mortality to 12 deaths 
per 1,000 and under five mortality 25 per 1,000 live births. One strategy that is effective in 
improving neonatal outcomes is clinical audits including perinatal and neonatal death audits.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;"id="clinicalaudit">Clinical Audits</h2>

<p>Audits are part of a quality improvement process to enhance patient care and outcomes through 
systematic review of care against standard criteria. Gaps are identified and appropriate 
interventions are planned and implemented. Changes are implemented at an individual, team 
or service level. The assessment is repeated to monitor progress towards the standard of care. 
Ongoing monitoring and evaluation are used to track improvement in health care delivery and 
progress towards the goal.</p>
<p>A clinical audit is not research as its purpose is for local use to improve clinical care.</p>
<p><em>Audits are there to improve bad systems not to find bad people.</em></p>

</table>

<p><b>Conducting the Clinical Audit</b></p>

<p>The files of patients from the assessment period should be reviewed and required data should be 
extracted and entered into the data collection form. This will be summarised and analysed in 
comparison to the required standard. The audit should be done by the team instead of left to one 
person e.g., the coordinator, so that everyone takes ownership of it.</p>

<p>Once the assessment has been done, the results should be shared with the ward team as well 
as management. Identify reasons that the standard of care has not been met and agree on 
strategies on how to address the gaps. E.g., ensuring everyone knows what the standard is, 
ensuring they have the resources to meet the standard.</p>

<p>Progress on the target can be determined by a repeat of the audit after interventions have been 
instigated. The time can be agreed on by the team, e.g., reassess progress after 2 months.</p>

</tr>

</table>

<p>Intermediate goals may be agreed upon e.g., improve assessment from 40% to 60% in the next 
quarter.</p>

<p>Displaying the progress on a graph in the ward can be a way of motivating staff to see how far 
they have come and the progress towards a goal. A small celebration can be made in the ward 
upon meeting the standard but remember that the aim is to not only to achieve the standard but 
to maintain it, so ongoing monitoring and evaluation should be done.</p>

<h2 id="deathaudit" style="color:blue;">Neonatal Death Audit</h2>

<p>The neonatal death audit process is part of a cycle that aims to improve neonatal outcomes by 
identifying and reporting neonatal deaths, understanding the trends of mortality and their 
contributing factors then instigates interventions to address the gaps.</p>

<p>N.B. The aim of a death audit is not to assign blame and witch hunt but rather to identify and 
address gaps in the system that can contribute to mortality. To facilitate a “no name, no blame, 
no shame” system names should not be included in the reviewed documents.</p>

review of paediatric mortality. Geneva: World Health Organization;

<p>The death audit is a part of a quality improvement process and should be part of an ongoing 
process.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue;">How to Conduct a Neonatal Death Audit</h3>

<p>Conducting death audits should be taken as part of routine care and the ongoing process to 
optimise the care provided to mothers and neonates in our facilities.</p> 

<p><b>Who should be involved?</b></p>

<p>The team should be composed of those responsible for caring for the patients on the ward, either 
in the neonatal unit, the labour ward or theatre and hospital administrators. Senior people within 
a district facility who can make decisions should participate as without them it may be difficult to 
make and implement meaningful decisions. The MOHP has agreed on the establishment of 
Quality Improvement Support Team (QIST) members who are members of the DHMT (District 
Health Management teams) and a member should be a part of this process</p>

<p>Below is a suggested process of how to carry out a death audit and the team that should be 
involved:</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin161.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin161.png" max-width="100%"/></a>
<small>Zoom in for details. </small><br/>

<br>

<ul>
<li> Hospital Administrator</li>
<li> Clinician managers – DNO, DMO</li>
<li> Clinicians and nurses </li>
<li> Facility Quality Improvement Support Team (QIST) members</li>
<li> Data collection officer or clerk</li>
<li> Patients and patient interest groups, e.g., hospital advisory committees although these 
are rarely involved in our setting</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Planning for the Audit</b></p>

<p>The neonatal death review form should be filled within 72 hours of a neonatal death by a member 
of the team managing the patient. This form captures key information regarding the death that 
may assist in conducting the audit but also captures information without health workers names. 
These should be compiled in preparation for the neonatal death audit meeting.</p> 

<p>Source data for filling this form include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li> Patient files including monitoring charts and clinical notes;</li> 
<li> Maternal partograph and history</li>
<li> Referral letters if relevant</li>
<li> Laboratory results and those of any other investigations conducted eg imaging</li>
</ul>

<p>A copy of the neonatal death review form is in the appendix.</p>

<p><b>Communicate with members of the audit team. </b>If this was not done already, send out minutes 
and a report of the previous death audit which should include action points. Each facility must 
agree on the frequency with which they will hold neonatal death audits. This will vary depending 
on the capacity of the facility but they must be done at least monthly, but some will do this weekly,
or fortnightly. Be clear on the period that the audit will cover e.g., 6th to 19th January 2020. </p>

<p><b>Compile the statistics for the review period including admissions and all the deaths that 
occurred within the evaluation period.</b> The data required is listed in the neonatal death 
consolidation form. A specific person must be assigned to do this and will likely need the help of 
the clerk. To make this process easier, all death files should be kept in one agreed but secure 
place e.g., a box on the neonatal unit where the ward clerk can easily find them. This will avoid 
wasting time trying to track down individual file and minimise the list of missing files.</p>

<p>N.B. The team should take note of the quality of data being generated through clinical notes, 
admission forms and registers. Gaps should be monitored and fed back and action points jointly 
agreed upon. Poor quality and incomplete data will negatively impact decision making.</p>

<p><b>Prepare the forms and documentation required for the neonatal death audit meeting.</b></p>

<li><a class="seealso" href="A5_NeonatalAudit.html#modi"> List of modifiable factors.</a></li> 
<li> Source files in case some information may be required for clarification.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:blue;">Conducting the Death Audit</h3>

<p>Aim to start and finish on time so that people become accustomed to the schedule and are more 
likely to attend. Agree on a secretary and chairperson, these roles should rotate so that everyone 
takes responsibility. </p>

<p><b>Key Activities</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Review previous minutes.</li>
<li> Report of the trend of admissions and mortality.</li>
<li> Review of deaths. Ideally every death should be reviewed in this forum, however, this is 
not always practical, especially in busy facilities where the deaths may be many. The 
facility may decide to either meet more regularly or sample some of the deaths. An agreed 
number can be reviewed and sampled in a random order.</li>
<li> Determining cause of death.</li>
<li> Decide on the cause of death based on information provided on the review form. In some 
cases source data may be required but this must be avoided to maintain anonymity. Where 
the source document is required the information required should be identified by a senior 
responsible officer and the document should not be circulated in the meeting. A possible 
list of causes of death are provided and the team must select from these. Note that a baby 
may have several problems but it must be agreed on the one most likely to have resulted 
in death. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Identification of Modifiable Factors</b></p>

<p>Having identified the cause of death, modifiable factors should be identified from the list and 
categories provided. N.B. there is often more than one modifiable factor for each death.</p>

<p>The list of modifiable factors has two sections, one for the facility where the death occurred and 
another for the referring facility if relevant. Each section is further categorised into clinical, 
administrative and caregiver factors.</p>
<ul>
<li> Clinical factors – all clinical care provided is compared to the standard of care as defined 
by the national guidelines, in this case the COIN manual. Areas reviewed include initial 
assessment, identification of problems and management provided, monitoring and 
adequacy of documentation. For referring facilities this includes timeliness of referral, care 
pre and during referral, communication and documentation.</li> 
<li> Administrative problems – includes infrastructure, resources including equipment, 
electricity, drugs and staff, transport and communication for referral. Again, these are 
compared to what each facility is expected to provide based on their level (health centre, 
district or community hospital.</li>
<li> Caregiver factors – this section areas such as delay in presentation, use of harmful 
traditional herbs, refusal of care or referral.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the diagram below, one can identify several points at which improvements in care could 
have reduced the risk of death for the patient.</p>

</figure>
<small>Zoom in for details. </small><br/>


<p>In the meeting, the top 4 or 5 modifiable factors should be identified then a root cause analysis 
should be conducted for each. The aim of this approach is to ensure that the actual problem is 
identified otherwise interventions implemented will not yield results. Analysis can be done using 
the <q>5 why analysis</q>.</p>

<h3 id="5why">5 Why Analysis</h3>

<p>Once a problem is identified, the reviewers should keep asking “why?” until they arrive at the 
underlying or root cause of the problem. On average, a root cause is identified after repeating the 
process 5 times.</p>

<p><b>Example: </b>Modifiable factor, inadequate monitoring of the patient blood glucose.<br/> 
Why? They had to borrow a glucometer from the paediatric ward and it was in use.<br/>
Why? The ward glucometer is not working.<br />
Why? The batteries are flat.<br />
Why? Batteries were requested but not supplied.<br />
Why? Stores office does not keep that type of battery.</p>

<p>When the team conducting the audit is satisfied that they have identified the problem, action points 
should be clear, have a responsible person/office assigned to the task and a timeline.</p>

<p>For the example above and possible action point could be:</p>

<p><em><q>By the end of .....(date) a sample of the required batteries should be provided to stores by the 
nurse in charge so that they can buy the correct batteries.</em></q></p>

<p><b>Summary and Report of the Audit</b></p>

<p>Information proceeding from the meeting should be summarised in the neonatal death audit 
consolidation form together with minutes documenting progress on previous action points and the 
date of the next meeting. These should be circulated to members present and to managers for 
accountability and follow up of action points. It is helpful for a coordinator or in-charge to brief key 
management members in person on the audit findings and areas that need their particular 
support. The next meeting must pick up on the action points to allow continuity and to see the 
impact of the intervention.</p>
