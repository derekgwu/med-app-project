<p><strong>Assessment of oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter should be used as part of 
routine assessment for all infants on admission.</strong></p>

<p>Pulse oximeters should also be used during treatment for all sick or at-risk patients, or 
those being treated with oxygen therapy <b>(1.1a, 1.1b),</b> CPAP <b>(1.2),</b> or any form of assisted 
ventilation.<b>(1.3)</b></p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p><strong>Peripheral pulse oximetry is a non-invasive & painless process of measuring heart 
rate and oxygen saturation (oxygen bound to haemoglobin in the capillaries).</strong></p>

<p>Pulse oximeters may be used to help determine the severity of an infant’s illness by 
evaluating if blood oxygen saturation is low and if respiratory support is needed. Pulse 
oximeters also may be used to assess the success of treatment and determine a need 
for increasing or decreasing respiratory interventions to achieve target SpO2.</p>

<p>Pulse oximeters have one red- and one infra-red light-emitting diode and a photodetector. 
<b>(2.1)</b> The light emitted by the diodes is absorbed by tissues, and amount of absorption is 
measured by the photodetector. Functional haemoglobin bound with oxygen is called 
oxyhaemoglobin. Percent saturation of oxygen bound to haemoglobin is called SpO<sub>2</sub>. A 
microprocessor within the pulse oximeter determines the percent of oxygen in the blood 
by comparing the concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin to oxyhaemoglobin at two different 
light wavelengths. <b>(2.2)</b></p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin22a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin22a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin22b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin22b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>


<p>When using a pulse oximeter, several factors impact the stability of the patient’s trace. 
Examples of a “normal signal” & potential “poor traces” are below.<b> (2.3)</b></p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin22f.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin22f.png" max-width="100%"/></a>


<p>Pulse oximeters may be:</p>

<ul>
<li> Fixed <b>(2.4)</b> (for continuous reading of one patient)</li>
<li> Handheld <b>(2.5)</b> (for spot reading vital signs between patients, or the same patient at 
intervals)</li>
<li> Finger clip <b>(2.6)</b> (for continuous or spot reading of vital signs; only appropriate for adult 
or older paediatric patients. NOT recommended for use in neonatal patients)</li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The same pulse oximeter can be used for adult, paediatric, and neonatal patients. The 
alarm settings should be changed on the oximeter and appropriately sized probes must 
be used. Probe size will vary depending on patient age.</p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin23a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin23a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin23b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin23b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin23c.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin23c.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Normal SpO<sub>2</sub> for neonatal patients should be:<p>
<ul>
<li><b> 90% - 100% if not on oxygen</b></li>
<li> <b>90-95% on oxygen (Alert 2.1)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>If SpO<sub>2</sub> readings are less than 90%, the patient should be considered for supplemental 
oxygen therapy (see oxygen concentrator module).</p> 

<p><b>Oxygen saturations, heart rate, and clinical condition should all correspond.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CARING FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Allow the patient’s trace to establish before reading SpO2 and heart rate. <b>(3.8)</b>
These should correspond to patient’s clinical condition. If they do not correspond, 
reposition the probe to ensure good contact with the patient.</li> 
<li> Record SpO<sub>2</sub> and heart rate in patient documentation. Pulse oximeters are 
inaccurate for readings under 70%; readings between 20% and 60% do not
correlate to clinical deterioration or improvement. (Alert 3.2) A low reading should 
alert you to look for a problem with the probe fixation, baby or oximeter.</li>
<li> If continuously monitoring patient, periodically check the sensor site <b>(3.9)</b> during 
monitoring for evidence of skin damage.</li>
<li> Keep the parents informed of baby’s progress.</li>

<h3 class="lb_background">REMOVING A PATIENT</h3>

<p>Removing the probe from the patient varies based on the type of probe in use:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>If using an adhesive wrap probe:</b> peel adhesive away from patient & pull probe away 
from patient. Disinfect probe site on patient & wrap probe with 70% alcohol if reusing.</li>
<li><b>If using a rubber wrap probe:</b> unthread rubber connecting strip through the hole. Pull 
probe away from patient. Disinfect probe site on patient & the wrap probe with 70% 
alcohol.</li>
<li><b>If using a clip probe:</b> press on the tips of the clip probe to open. Gently pull away from 
patient. Disinfect probe site on patient and clean probe with 70% alcohol.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><strong>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospitalacquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not 
disinfected or reprocessed promptly or adequately between patients, they may 
pose a significant infection risk.</strong></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or 70% alcohol before and after assessing a 
patient using a pulse oximeter or handling any probes that will be used on a patient.</li> 
<li> Ensure that all patient-related consumables (including probes) are new or have 
been cleaned thoroughly before use. Any patient-related consumables must be 
cleaned before they are used to assess another patient using the pulse oximeter.</li>
<li> All patient-related consumables should be stored in a clean, dry location. Keep 
cleaned probes separate from those waiting to be cleaned. Any cables should be 
loosely wrapped & secured, preventing sharp bends, pinches or kinks, which will 
decrease their lifetime. </li>
</ol>
<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Clean reusable probes with alcohol. Adhesive probes are specified for single-use; 
if reusing disinfect sensor with alcohol. <b>(Alert 4.1)</b></li>
<li> If pulse oximeters or patient consumables (including probes) are not cleaned 
thoroughly before use, infection can be transmitted. Care should be taken 
particularly for consumables marked as single-use but are reused (such as 
adhesive wrap probes).</li>
<li> Between patients, wipe down the pulse oximeter with alcohol. <b>(4.1)</b> Be careful not 
to submerge or drip alcohol onto the pulse oximeter or any of its cables.</li>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Misdiagnosis:</b> a poor trace <b>(5.1)</b> may contribute to misdiagnosis and can result from:</li>
<li><b>Hypovolaemia/hypotension:</b> poor peripheral perfusion or movement may cause a false 
reading.</li>
<li><b>Peripheral cyanosis/anaemia:</b> poor oxygen delivery to the tissues, compromises
measured saturation. Saturation readings below 70% are not reliable as clinical 
guides.</li>
<li><b>Hypothermia:</b> causes poor peripheral perfusion which in turn can provide an inaccurate 
representation of the oxygen saturation within the blood.</li></ul>

<a href="../assets/images/coin33.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin33.png" max-width="50%"/></a><br/>
<p><small>Zoom in to see details</small></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Pressure sores:</b> if the pulse oximeter probe is attached too tightly, inappropriately or too
long at one site, pressure sores may develop. The warmth of the light may irritate the skin
of a premature baby which is why the probe needs regular repositioning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Poorly fitting probes can lead to inaccurate saturation measurements:</b> if the probe is 
too large for the patient, the probe will shift in place, creating issues both in terms of 
inconsistent measurement due to multiple contact points as well as the potential to have 
no direct contact points with the skin. If the probe is too small for the patient, blood flow 
may be constricted and the reading affected. Also, the light and sensor must be positioned 
opposite each other.</li> 
<li><b>Patient movement:</b> as the patient moves, the contact point between the probe and the 
patient moves along the patient’s skin. This movement provides an inconsistent 
measurement because it samples from various contact points in the skin, rather than 
remaining in the same contact point of tissue.</li>
<li><b>Strong light:</b> if strong light (e.g., phototherapy, exam lights, or sunlight) is on a probe 
sensor, the light signal from the pulse oximeter probe may be drowned out by the stronger 
environmental light, leading to incorrect results. A cloth covering of the sensor site will 
protect it from bright light.</li>
<li><b>Oximeter alarm settings:</b> pulse oximeters may have adult, paediatric, and neonatal 
settings in the same device. <b>(5.2)</b> Pulse oximeters are usually set to a default adult setting. 
If the pulse oximeter is not set to neonatal parameters, alarms may sound inappropriately.</li>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>A pulse oximeter is powered by replaceable or rechargeable<b> (6.1)</b> batteries. If using a 
rechargeable device, the users should regularly charge the pulse oximeter when not in 
use to ensure power in the event of a power outage.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>When using the pulse oximeter, the device should be placed in a secure location to 
prevent drops and breakages. The device and associated probes should be stored in a 
clean, dry, and secure area. The device should never be placed inside a cot or bassinet.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>Preventive maintenance should be conducted to ensure that the pulse oximeter is in good 
working order for emergency use.</p>

<ol>
<li> Turn on the pulse oximeter. Connect the probe and check for a red light.</li>
<li>Connect a clip probe and test readings on your finger for normal saturations (above 90%).
