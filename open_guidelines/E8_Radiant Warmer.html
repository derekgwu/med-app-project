<b>Temperature less than 36°C at birth has been recognised as an independent risk factor for death in preterm infants. <sup>1,2</sup></b>

<p>Radiant warmers may be used on any neonatal patient admitted to the nursery ward, but 
especially for:</p>
<ul>
<li> Initial assessment of a sick or <a class="seealso" href="C9_Preterm.html"> 
premature</a> baby</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C10_Hypothermia.html">Hypothermia</a></li>
<li> Undertaking invasive procedures</li>
<li> <a class="seealso" href="C3_ResuscNewborn.html">Resuscitation</a></li>
<li> When stabilising a sick baby</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="lb_background">OBSTETRIC & LABOUR NOTE</h3>

<p><b>In stable newborns priority should always be given to skin-to-skin and KMC over 
artificial warming devices.</b> Unstable babies and any requiring resuscitation need an 
area post-delivery to prevent hypothermia. Using pre-warmed towels, neonatal patients 
should immediately be dried, with one towel that is then discarded and replaced by 
another dry one, wrapped and placed under a radiant warmer following delivery. Newborn 
babies can drop their body temperature very quickly, even within minutes. They must be 
kept warm from the moment of birth, during their time in the labour ward and when 
transferred to the nursery. <b>Even small drops in temperature increase the likelihood 
of mortality.</b><sup>2–4</sup></p>

<p>Extremely premature babies can be placed in a clean plastic bag immediately after birth, 
without prior drying and ensuring the head is kept free from the plastic.<sup>4</sup>
<b>(1.1)</b> The head 
is covered with a hat. This assists prevention of heat loss. A baby in a plastic bag must 
be monitored very frequently to prevent overheating.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin105.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin105.png" max-width="100%"/></a>

<p>Regardless of location, it is preferential to start patients on 
<a class="seealso" href="C9_Preterm.html#KMC">Kangaroo Mother Care</a> if it is 
clinically appropriate and the patient is stable.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>However warm a room may feel to an adult, a neonate can lose heat. This heat loss 
in neonatal patients is rapid, with hypothermia directly contributing to mortality.<sup>2–4</sup>
Radiant warmers (2.1) use overhead heating elements to provide radiating heat 
ensuring maintenance of normothermia.</b></p>

<p>Newborn babies lose heat through four main mechanisms.<sup>5</sup></p>

<ul>
<li><b> Evaporation:</b> water loss through the skin.</li>
<li><b> Radiation:</b> heat radiating from the warmer patient towards cooler surfaces (e.g., windows
or walls).</li>
<li><b> Conduction:</b> direct heat travel from warmer surface of the skin to the cooler mat or cot on
which the patient rests.</li>
<li><b> Convection:</b> air currents move heat away from the skin/body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Radiant warmers provide radiating heat to minimise metabolic requirements for heat 
production, decreasing the risks of hypoglycaemia and respiratory distress associated 
with hypothermia. Radiant warmers provide an area where resuscitations, procedures, 
and short-term observation can take place while keeping the baby warm. Warmers may 
vary in complexity, including only heating functionality or heating functionality with 
resuscitation and oxygen equipment. All warmers include a temperature probe that 
provides information on the patient’s temperature. <b>(2.2)</b></p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin106.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin106.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin106a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin106a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Radiant warmers heat in various modes, the names of which may vary based on device: 
<b>(2.3)</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b> Prewarm:</b> provides constant low heat for a short amount of time (typically 10 minutes or
less) to prepare the cot underneath the warmer to receive a patient.</li>
<li> <b>Automatic:</b> also called servo or baby mode; uses a temperature probe on the baby to
automatically adjust heat provided to maintain the patient’s temperature within an
acceptable range.</li>
<li><b> Manual: </b>provides a constant, unadjusting heat that is set by the user. Patients should
never be left unattended if being treated in manual mode.</li>

</ul>
<a href="../assets/images/coin107.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin107.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Normothermic axillary temperature in neonates ranges from 36.5<sup>o</sup>C to 
37.5<sup>o</sup>C.<sup>4,5</sup> <b>Every effort 
must be made to keep a baby's temperature within the normal range as temperature below 
36<sup>o</sup>C is an independent risk factor for death in newborns.<sup>1,2</sup></b></p>

<h2 id="Management">Management</h2>

<p><b>Management covers how to use the radiant warmer, including set up for a patient, 
patient preparation & commencement, care whilst on the device & removal of the 
patient from the device</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">SETTING UP FOR A PATIENT</h3>


<ol>
<li> Plug power cable into the radiant warmer. <b>(3.1)</b> Plug power cable into a wall socket 
& surge protector if available and switch on the power. <b>(3.2)</b></li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin108.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin108.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin108a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin108a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<li> Select manual setting at 25% or Prewarm setting (if available on model). <b>(3.3)</b></li>

<a href="../assets/images/coin108b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin108b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Plug temperature probe into the infant temperature probe port. <b>(3.4) </b>Hold 
temperature probe in hand and move hand directly under overhead heating 
elements to check for heat. <b>(3.5)</b> You should be able to feel heat emitting from the 
heating elements. <b>(3.6) </b>Allow bedding to grow warm while waiting for the baby to 
arrive in the nursery, be transferred to the radiant warmer, or be delivered in the 
labour ward.</li>
</ol>
<a href="../assets/images/coin109.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin109.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin109a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin109a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin109b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin109b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h3 class="lb_background">PREPARING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li>Collect:
<ul>Tape or elastic bandage</ul>
<ul>Gauze</ul>
<ul>70% alcohol</ul></li>
<li>Always explain the purpose, risks, and benefits of a procedure to guardians BEFORE
performing the procedure.</li>
<li>Follow handwashing protocol.</li>
<li>Ensure patient is dry from any birth fluids or bodily secretions and is wearing a hat to
prevent excess heat loss from the head.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">STARTING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Ensure radiant heater has been prewarmed. If the radiant warmer has not been 
prewarmed, then take steps to do so. Prewarming is essential in order to prevent infant 
from losing heat to the mattress when initially placed on the warmer.</li>
<li> Change the radiant warmer from <b>Pre-Warm </b>to select <b>Servo/Automatic</b> mode. <b>(3.7)</b></li>
<li> Position infant in middle of radiant warmer cot, maintaining additional treatment tubing 
(e.g., CPAP tubing, IV lines) in place. <b>(3.8)</b></li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin110.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin110.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin110a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin110a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<li> Use gauze and 70% alcohol to clean temperature probe.</li>
<li> Place temperature probe directly above infant’s liver and secure with tape or elastic 
bandage. <b>(3.9)</b> If a child with myelomeningocele needs to be cared for prone, then place 
the probe over the infant’s flank. The probe should be secured firmly enough that it will 
not fall off the patient, but not so firmly that it is pressing into the infant’s skin.</li>


<a href="../assets/images/coin110b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin110b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> If used in servo mode, the <b>goal temperature</b> for the baby is usually set to a default 36.5<sup>0</sup>C. 
The user may change the goal temperature depending on patient’s clinical status.</li> 
<li> Ideally, each radiant warmer should be used for one baby with a temperature probe 
dedicated for that patient. Sharing of a radiant warmer and temperature probe poses a 
risk for temperature regulation and infection control. If multiple patients are sharing one 
warmer, regular temperature monitoring must be conducted using a temperature probe or 
thermometer. If the radiant heater is used in manual mode, the baby must be constantly 
attended as there is a real danger of overheating.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">CARING FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Monitor the patient’s temperature 5 minutes after starting on radiant warmer, and then 4 
hourly (if in <b>servo</b> mode) or every 30 minutes (if in <b>manual </b>mode).</li>
<li> Pay close attention to any alarms:</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li> <b>Temperature:</b> the infant temperature probe has recorded temperatures below
<b>(3.10)</b> or above <b>(3.11)</b> the safe range for the patient. Assess if the patient is too hot
or cold and change the radiant warmer settings accordingly. Check probe is not
dislodged from the baby.</li>

<a href="../assets/images/coin111.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin111.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin111a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin111a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<li><b> Probe:</b> the temperature probe is not secured in the radiant warmer appropriately
or the probe has malfunctioned. <b>(3.12)</b> Make sure the probe is plugged in; if the
alarm continues, replace the probe or contact your maintenance department.</li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin111b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin111b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> <b>Power:</b> the mains power has failed. <b>(3.13)</b> Turn off the power button on the radiant
warmer control and move the patient to a working warmer.</li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin111c.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin111c.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> <b>System:</b> the radiant warmer has recorded a problem with its system. <b>(3.14)</b> This
may result in the radiant warmer no longer providing heat or no longer monitoring
the patient. Move the patient to a working warmer and contact your maintenance
department.</li>
</ul>

<a href="../assets/images/coin111d.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin111d.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h3 class="lb_background">REMOVING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Collect:</li>
<ul>
<li> Gauze</li>
<li> 70% alcohol</li>
</ul>

<li> Gently remove tape/bandage holding temperature probe from patient. <b>(3.15)</b></li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin112.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin112.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Disinfect probe site on patient and temperature probe with gauze and 70% alcohol.</li>
<li> Turn off warmer using switch and unplug.</li>
<li> Check the patient’s temperature after 30 minutes off the warmer, to ensure normal 
body temperature is maintained.</li>
<li> Disinfect the cot before reuse.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospital-acquired infections in newborn care units.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li> Clean hands with soap and water or 70% alcohol before and after placing a patient 
in a radiant warmer or handling any consumables that will be used on a patient 
(e.g., temperature probe).</li>
<li> Ensure that all patient-related consumables (including probes) are new or have 
been cleaned thoroughly before use. Any patient-related consumables must be 
cleaned before they are used to assess another patient on the radiant warmer.</li>

<li> All patient-related consumables should be stored in a clean, dry location. Any 
cables should be loosely wrapped and secured, preventing sharp bends or kinks, 
which will decrease the lifetime of the cables. Do not pinch or bend the cables.</li>
<li> As mentioned in<b> <a href="#Management">Radiant Warmer: Management</a>,</b> each radiant warmer should be 
used for one baby with a temperature probe dedicated for that patient. Sharing of 
a radiant warmer and temperature probe poses a high risk for infection 
transmission between patients. If the patient probe and surfaces are not cleaned 
thoroughly before use, infection can also be transmitted.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Turn off and unplug the radiant warmer, if not using with another patient. Allow to 
cool.</li>
<li> After every use, use gauze and 70% alcohol or diluted chlorine (Alert 4.1) to 
thoroughly wipe:</li>

<ul>
<li> Temperature probe, including cable and plug head</li>
<li> Control panel</li>
<li> Power button</li>
<li> Mattress – cleaning both sides</li>
<li> Cot walls</li>
</ul>
<li> Housing of the radiant warmer should be cleaned according to ward guidelines for 
disinfecting surfaces. </li>
</ol>

of equipment was taken from the <u>Infection Prevention and Control:
Reference Manual for Health Care Facilities with Limited Resources,
Jhpiego</u>, Module 6<sup>6</sup> which lists isopropyl alcohol (70-90%), sodium
hypochlorite (0.05% or >100ppm available chlorine) quaternary
ammonium, and Iodophor germicidal detergent as appropriate for low level
disinfection. Phenolic germicidal detergent is also listed in this category but
should not be used in neonatal wards since affordable, effective
alternatives are available; and, there are concerns it may cause
hyperbilirubinemia and/or neurotoxicity in neonates.<sup>7</sup>
When utilising re-processed devices meant for single-use (like temperature
probes), careful attention must always be paid to assure that devices are
continuing to function properly.

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>
<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device </b>
Ethics application 3463<b>complications for patients. Awareness of potential 
complications is critical to maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li><b> Hypothermia & cold stress: </b>if the device is not prepared correctly, is malfunctioning, or 
the baby is left exposed for a long period of time, there is a risk of hypothermia. This is 
associated with a significant increase in mortality and morbidity including respiratory 
distress syndrome, metabolic derangements, interventricular haemorrhage, and late onset 
sepsis.<sup>4</sup> Hypothermia additionally increases the risk of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm 
infants.<sup>2,4 </sup>If a baby is cold, rewarming must be careful and gradual.
<li> <b>Hyperthermia & heat stress: </b>hyperthermia can occur in patients whilst on manual mode </li>
who are not monitored regularly or on servo mode if the temperature probe falls off as they 
may become overheated. Risks of hyperthermia include increased fluid loss with 
development of hypernatraemic dehydration, convulsions, increased metabolism, 
tachypnoea, tachycardia, and recurrent apnoea.<sup>8–12</sup> <b>(Alert 5.1)</b></li>
<li> <b>Pressure sores: </b>pressure sores may develop if the patient is incorrectly positioned, is 
lying on additional tubing/equipment, or the temperature probe is not positioned correctly.</li>
<li> <b>Falls:</b> the cot sides of the radiant warmer must be in place to prevent the baby falling off 
the mattress on to the floor.</li>
<li> <b>Infection:</b> if the temperature probe or infant warmer are not cleaned thoroughly before 
use, infection can be transmitted. Care should be taken particularly for consumables that 
are marked as single-use but are reused in practice (such as temperature probes).</li>
</ul>

 </b></td>

<tr>
<td> There are two ways that an infant might have an elevated core 
temperature: (1) infection (2) environmental.
<ol>
<li><b>Infection:</b> In the case that an elevated temperature is generated 
by infection, there is no temperature which is considered
“dangerous” and would require additional alarms. Fever, regulated
by the hypothalamus, is the body’s normal response to infection or
inflammation which is induced by cytokine activation.</li>
<li><b>Environmental overheating:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Device overheating:</b> A device overheating an infant can lead
to a number of potentially dangerous outcomes that may
result in serious harm. Environmental overheating is not a
body’s normal response to an illness (as seen in fever) but
rather a mismatch between environmental heat and the ability
of the infant’s body to dissipate heat. Environmental
overheating may result in serious heat related illness
including damage to the central nervous system.<sup>8,9</sup> Compared
to older individuals, babies are at particularly high risk of
environmental overheating since they have higher heat
production (metabolic rates), higher surface area to mass
ratios (i.e., higher absorption of heat from environment), less
ability to dissipate heat and no ability to independently access
fluids.<sup>10-12</sup></li>
<li><b>Maternal heat transference:</b> Immediately following delivery
hyperthermia can be caused by maternal fever during labour
and delivery as foetal temperature is up to 1°C higher than
maternal temperature.<sup>13</sup></li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
Note on special circumstances: CNS injury, in which it is critical to avoid
hyperthermia in the first 72 hours following birth, may affect the newborn’s
temperature. However, CNS damage will typically result in temperature
instability rather than hyperthermia.<sup>13</sup>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Hyperthermia due to probe mismanagement:</b> if the device is set to automatically adjust
its temperature based on the patient’s temperature (servo mode) and the patient
temperature probe falls off the patient or is not well secured<b> (5.1),</b> the radiant warmer may
overheat in an attempt to compensate for what it observes as a low body temperature.
This puts the patient at risk for a body temperature >40<sup>o</sup>C and clinical harm</li>

<a href="../assets/images/coin116.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin116.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> <b>Alarms:</b> radiant warmers have in-built alarms that should sound if the patient’s
temperature is above or below a set normothermic range. If this range is not appropriately
set, alarms may sound at incorrect situations.</li>
<li><b>Fire:</b> if linen is placed on the radiant heater head, heat and dust may build up and pose a
fire hazard. Never store linen on top of the device or close to the heating elements.
Although treatment devices (e.g., phototherapy units, oxygen concentrators) can be used
with a radiant warmer, care should be taken to ensure that the direct line of heat to the
patient from the radiant warmer heating elements is not obstructed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>Radiant warmers are powered with mains/socket power. Radiant warmers are typically 
the largest consumers of power in a nursery and should be plugged into their own socket 
and surge protector if available. <b>(6.1 & 6.2) </b>Radiant warmers typically draw too much
power to be used with small-scale solar systems. In most cases, the cost (both financially 
and energetically) to run radiant warmers during a power cut prevents them from being 
used with backup power.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin117.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin117.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin117a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin117a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>Radiant warmers should be placed against a wall with the power cable/stand facing the 
wall and control panel facing the middle of the nursery room. <b>(6.3)</b> Warmers should be 
away from any windows to avoid air currents disrupting heat radiation. Windows are 
preferably kept closed.</p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin118.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin118.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h3 class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>Preventive maintenance should be conducted weekly and should include:</p>

<ol>
<li><b> Test the heating elements and temperature probe:</b></li>

<ul>
<li> Plug in the machine. Connect the temperature probe. Turn the power switch to
ON. Leave the machine on for 1 minute.</li>
<li> Hold the temperature probe in the palm of your hand and hold your hand near the
overhead heating elements. Slowly move it from the part of the heating element
closest to the stand, moving towards the outside end of the heating element. You
should feel your hand progressively heat as you move it, and see the temperature
reading on the machine steadily increase.</li>
<li> If you feel any sections of the heating elements are not providing heat, contact
your maintenance department.</li>
</ul>
<li> <b>Test the power loss alarm:</b> while the radiant warmer is plugged in and turned on, 
turn off the power at the wall socket. An alarm should sound. If it does not sound, 
contact your maintenance department.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Repair</h2>

<p><b>Although users are not responsible for repairing their devices, there are steps that 
may be taken to troubleshoot first-line errors that may occur before contacting 
maintenance or engineering support.</b></p>
