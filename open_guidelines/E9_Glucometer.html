<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>

<p><b>Assessment of blood glucose with a glucometer should be conducted as part of 
routine assessment for all infants on admission.</b></p>

<p>Glucometers should also be used during continuing management for all sick or at-risk 
patients. Hypoglycaemia may present as:<sup>1</sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Jitteriness</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Hypotonia</li>
<li>Lethargy</li>
<li>Reduced level of consciousness</li>
<li>Failure to feed or poor feeding</li>
<li><a class="seealso" href="C16_ComaConvulsions.html#convulsion">Seizures</a></li>
<li><a class="seealso" href="C10_Hypothermia.html">Hypothermia</a></li>
<li><a class="seealso" href="C5_Breathing difficulties.html#apnoea">Apnoea</a>
 or irregular breathing</li>
</ul>

<p>Hypoglycaemia may also be asymptomatic or the signs may be very non-specific and 
identified incidentally as part of routine blood glucose testing.<sup>1</sup>
It is important to identify <br>
hypoglycaemia as it may lead to permanent brain damage. Prematurity, intrauterine 
growth retardation, birth asphyxia, babies born to diabetic mothers, and sick babies are 
all especially prone to develop hypoglycaemia.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Hypoglycaemia occurs in 10% of healthy neonates but can also directly contribute 
to both morbidity and mortality.<sup>2,3</sup> It is the most common medical emergency to 
occur in neonatal patients.</b></p>

<p>Glucometers <b>(2.1) </b>provide a rapid measurement of approximate whole blood glucose 
level<sup>1</sup>
to direct treatment for patients with mild to severe hypoglycaemia. Where available, 
point of care tests should be confirmed by laboratory analysis when hypoglycaemia is 
persistent, recurrent, or there is concern about accuracy of the point of care device.</p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin121.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin121.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Glucometers use test strips <b>(2.2) </b>with a glucose oxidase electrode. These strips generate 
a current proportional to the glucose in the blood that reacts with the glucose oxidase, 
which is then measured and analysed to determine an estimated blood glucose level. </p>
<br>

<a href="../assets/images/coin121a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin121a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<br>
<p>There are multiple types of glucometers, including portable and benchtop. Glucose strips 
that change colour according to a visual scale are also available for measuring glucose 
levels. <b>These are not recommended due to their higher inaccuracy and subjective 
nature of measurement.</b> Not all glucometers are accurately able to measure 
hypoglycaemia in neonatal patients;<sup>4,5</sup> all devices in use should be thoroughly validated 
for use both in neonatal patients and as an assessment of hypoglycaemia.</p>

<p>Glucose levels in all neonatal patients should not fall below <b>2.5 mmol/L </b>
(45 mg/dL).</p>


<h2 id="Management">Management</h2>

<p><b>Management of a glucometer covers how to use the device in a variety of settings, 
including set up for a patient, patient preparation & conducting & concluding the 
assessment.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">SETTING UP FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Collect: <b>(3.1)</b></li>
<ul>
<li> Glucometer</li>
<li> Glucometer strips</li>
<li> Control solutions</li>
</ul>
<li> Turn on the glucometer. This may be completed by pressing the power button of

<br>
<a href="../assets/images/coin122.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin122.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin122a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin122a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<br>

<li> Fully insert a test strip into the meter. <b>(3.2)</b> The strip should click into place. </li>
<li> A <b>Quality Control</b> test should be conducted daily. If this has not been completed, 
perform a test using the control solutions provided with the glucometer <b>(3.3),</b> or a 
solution of known glucose content. The solution should be placed on the strip as 
with a normal sample. <b>(3.4)</b> The results should appear within seconds as a <b>Pass.</b> 
<b>(3.5)</b></li></ol>

<h3 class="lb_background">PREPARING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Assess patient for clinical conditions associated with hypoglycaemia.</li>
<li> Always explain the purpose, risks and benefits of a procedure to guardians BEFORE 
performing the procedure.</li>
<li> Follow handwashing protocol and put on gloves.</li>
<li> Collect:</li>
<ul>
<li> Gloves</li>
<li> 70% Alcohol</li>
<li> Cotton swab</li>
</ul>


<li> Clean the skin on the outer edge of the patient’s heel using cotton wool soaked in alcohol. 
<b>(3.6)</b> Allow the alcohol to dry before testing. <b>Blood glucose samples should never be 
taken from the finger of a neonate. Avoid areas of skin which are poorly perfused, 
oedematous, inflamed or infected.</b></li>
</ol>

<br>
<a href="../assets/images/coin124.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin124.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h3 class="lb_background">ASSESSING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Collect: <b>(3.7)</b></li>
<ul>
<li> New lancet</li>
<li> Glucometer</li>
<li> Glucometer strip</li>
<li> Cotton swabs</li>
<li> Alcohol (swabs/solution)</li>
<li> Gloves</li>
<li> A small tray to carry the items above</li>
</ul>
<a href="../assets/images/coin125.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin125.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Follow handwashing procedures & put on gloves.</li>
<li> Insert glucometer strip into glucometer and ensure it is turned on.</li>
<li> Using the lancet, prick the disinfected outer edge of the heel. <b>(3.8)</b> A blood drop should 
form. If this does not occur, massage the heel to generate the blood drop. The patient may 
cry during blood collection as use of the lancet can be painful.</li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin125a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin125a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Wipe the first drop from the patient’s skin and generate an additional blood drop. Collect 
the second blood drop on the tip of the glucometer strip. <b>(3.9)</b> The glucometer should 
automatically absorb the blood drop.</li>

<br>
<a href="../assets/images/coin125b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin125b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<br>

<li> Using a dry cotton swab, apply pressure to the heel to stop the bleeding. <b>(3.10)</b></li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin126.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin126.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Blood glucose level will be displayed as a number on the glucometer screen. <b>(3.11)</b> Read 
and record the glucose levels. If the measurement is not in accord with the clinical 
condition of the patient, repeat the test.</li>
<br>
<a href="../assets/images/coin126a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin126a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<br>
<li> Compare glucose levels to normal standards.<sup>6</sup></li>

<ul>
<li> If levels fall <b>below 2.5 mmol/L </b>(45mg/dL) but the baby is <b>alert</b>, can breastfeed, be
fed by cup and spoon or has a nasogastric tube, give extra feed and recheck in 2
hours.</li>
<li> If levels fall <b>below 2.5 mmol/L </b>(45mg/dL) but the baby is <b>unable to feed</b>,
immediately administer 2 mL/kilogram 10% dextrose IV and then start an infusion
of 10% dextrose.</li>
<li> If levels fall <b>below 1.2 mmol/L</b> (21.6mg/dL) in <b>any baby</b>, immediately administer
2 mL/kilogram 10% dextrose IV and then start an infusion of 10% dextrose.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="lb_background">CONCLUDING ASSESSMENT</h3>

<p>Remove the glucose strip from the glucometer and dispose of strip in hazardous waste 
container. Dispose of the used lancet in sharps container. Remove gloves, dispose in 
hazardous waste container, and wash hands.</p>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospital-acquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not 
disinfected or reprocessed promptly or adequately between patients, they may 
pose a significant infection risk.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li>Clean hands with soap and water or alcohol before and after assessing a patient 
using a glucometer or handling any materials that will be used on a patient (e.g., a 
lancet). <b>Gloves should be worn throughout the process of taking a blood 
glucose measurement and disposed of immediately after concluding the 
measurement.</b></li> 
<li> Always thoroughly clean the patient’s skin before taking a measurement using a 
glucometer. Inadequate cleaning of the skin may result in an infection. Taking a 
sample from a site with a skin infection also poses the risk of infection 
dissemination.</li>
<li> Ensure that all patient-related consumables are new before use. Materials used in 
blood glucose measurements <b>should never be reused. </b></li>
<li> All patient-related consumables should be stored in a clean, dry location. 
Glucometer measurement strips should be stored in an airtight container and 
according to hospital policy.</li>
<li> Follow universal precautions of handling sharps.</li>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Bruising:</b> inappropriate or repeated attempts to collect blood for glucose testing may 
result in bruising to the heel.</li>
<li> <b>Bleeding:</b> if pressure is not applied post blood collection bleeding may persist for a short 
period of time. Continued bleeding may indicate an underlying bleeding disorder.</li>
<li><b>Artery, nerve or bone damage:</b> do not use the back or the inner part of the heel for blood 
collection. This may cause artery, nerve, or bone damage.</li>
<li> <b>Pain:</b> the lancet prick can cause pain, employ appropriate soothing measures.</li>
<li> <b>Infection:</b> rarely infection may occur at the site if infection precautions are not adequate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Falsely high readings:</b> dextrose gel or substances on the skin can affect readings. If you 
record a very high reading in a patient that is otherwise showing symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia, consider recleaning the patient’s skin and retaking the measurement.</li>

<li> <b>Expired glucose strips:</b> outdated or improperly stored glucose strips can produce
inaccurate readings. Make sure the lid is kept tightly on the strip container as humidity
damages the strips. When possible, unexpired glucometer strips should not be used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>A glucometer is powered by replaceable or rechargeable <b>(6.1)</b> batteries. If using a 
rechargeable device, the users should regularly charge the pulse oximeter when not in 
use to ensure power in the event of a power outage.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>The glucometer and associated glucometer testing strips should be stored in a clean, dry 
and secure area. As glucometers are fairly small, care should be taken to ensure that 
they remain on the ward and accessible for use when required. If the glucometer has a 
docking or charging station, it should be kept on the dock or charging station when not in 
use. <b>(6.2)</b></p>

<h3 id="preventive" class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>Glucometers require little preventive maintenance beyond recharging or replacing 
batteries. <b>A Quality Control</b> test using the control solutions provided with the glucometer 
<b>(6.3)</b>, or a solution of known glucose content should be conducted monthly or when 
changing glucometer strip containers to ensure consistent results. The solution should be 
placed on the strip as with a normal sample. <b>(6.4)</b> The results should appear within 
seconds as a <b>Pass. (6.5)</b></p>
