<p>The NYI requires oxygen, if oxygen saturation is <b>less than 
90%.</b></p>

<p>Normal oxygen saturations (SpO<sub>2</sub>) for neonatal patients should be:</p>

<ul>
<li> 90%-100% if not on oxygen</li>
<li> 90%-95% on oxygen</li>
</ul>

<p>NB neonatal patients should reach oxygen saturations of 90 – 95% by 15 minutes after birth.</p>

<p>If there is severe respiratory distress, SpO<sub>2</sub> readings are less than 90% or there is central cyanosis 
the patient should be commenced on supplemental oxygen therapy.</p>

<h2 id="delivery">Delivery Methods of Oxygen</h2>

<p>The source of oxygen is generally the oxygen concentrator but may also be an oxygen cylinder. 
Oxygen is administered preferably by nasal prongs, but if unavailable nasal catheters can be 
used. If higher amounts of oxygen are required face masks can be used.</p>

<p>A baby with cyanosis or severe respiratory distress should be allowed to take a comfortable 
position of his choice and should be given oxygen immediately via nasal prongs or catheter.
Escalate the oxygen therapy in a stepwise fashion depending on need and availability.</p>

<p><b>If the baby’s breathing difficulty does not improve on prongs or catheter oxygen, 
despite increasing the flow:</b></p>

<p>Place the YI on oxygen at a high flow rate (4 litres/min) via face mask if possible or if this is 
unavailable, or if the breathing difficulties persist, then place the baby on <a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html">bCPAP</a>.</p>

<p><b>Monitoring and ongoing care of the patient:</b></p>

<p><em>(Teach the mother to help her baby by also looking out for the following problems):</em></p>

<ul>
<li> Displacement of the prongs or catheter.
<li> The concentrator malfunctioning or being accidentally switched off.
<li> Nursing staff need to check 4 hourly the position and patency of upper airway.
<li> The airways may become blocked with mucus.
<li> The abdomen may become distended with air.
<li> Respiratory distress may increase.
<li> Check oxygen saturations using pulse oximeter as clinical signs alone cannot be reliably 
predict hypoxia (aim at 90-95% oxygen saturation).
<li> Apply nasal drops at least every 4 hours.
<li> Keep warm.
<li> Feed regularly.
<li> Prevent infection.
</ul>

<p>If breathing difficulty is so severe that the baby has central cyanosis even with high flow oxygen 
or bCPAP, or the work of breathing increases despite increased oxygen delivery, rule out a 
pneumothorax clinically or with a chest x-ray. Discuss with senior or colleague.</p>

<h2 id="stop">When and How to Stop Oxygen Therapy</h2>

<p>Once patients can maintain normal oxygen saturations and are clinically stable, the oxygen flow 
rate should be reduced in a stepwise manner, based on clinical response:</p>

<ul>
<li> Reduce oxygen flow by 0.5 L/min, rechecking oxygen saturations and clinical condition
after 15 minutes.</li>
<li> If oxygen saturations and clinical condition remain stable, continue reducing oxygen flow
by 0.5 L/min, rechecking saturations 15 minutes after each reduction.</li>
<li> If oxygen saturations drop below 90% or the patient clinically deteriorates, increase the
oxygen until normal oxygen saturations are obtained and the patient clinically improves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once oxygen saturations are consistently above 95% at 0.5 L/min and the patient is clinically 
stable, remove oxygen from the patient by gently removing the tape and taking the prongs out of 
the patient’s nostrils. </p>

<p>Recheck the saturations after 15 minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li> If oxygen saturations have dropped or there is a clinical deterioration, recommence
oxygen.</li>
<li> If oxygen saturations and clinical condition are stable, the patient no longer requires
oxygen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where pulse oximetry is not available, the duration of oxygen therapy is guided by clinical signs. 
If oxygen saturations are not available, the oxygen can be stopped if the baby does not have 
respiratory distress,(i.e., no increased work of breathing, no increased respiratory rate, and baby 
not tiring), but keep under review and recommence if the respiratory distress increases after 
stopping the oxygen.</p>

<p>Avoid prolonged SpO<sub>2</sub> > 96% in premature infants as it can cause damage to the eyes 
(retinopathy of prematurity) leading to blindness, and can cause damage to the brain and the 
lungs. Premature infants should have oxygen saturations kept within 90-94% when given 
supplementary oxygen or CPAP.</p>

<p><b>Sources and delivery methods of oxygen </b></p>

<p>See supplement on <a class="seealso" href="E3_Oxygen concentrator.html">oxygen concentrator</a> module.</p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin66.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin66.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<ul><li>The source of oxygen is generally the <b>oxygen 
concentrator</b>. These usually deliver 5 -10 litres of 
oxygen per minute and there is a gauge for adjusting 
the concentration of oxygen. The filter at the back of 
the concentrator should be cleaned every week to 
keep them working well. Sufficient oxygen should be 
given to keep oxygen saturations above 90%.</li></ul>
<a href="../assets/images/coin67.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin67.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Nasal prongs:</b>Prongs come in different sizes. Nasal 
prongs are preferred over nasal tube or catheter for 
delivering oxygen to young infants. Place them just 
inside the nostrils and secure with a piece of tape on the 
cheeks near the nose.</p>
<p>Take care that the nostrils are kept clear of mucus, 
which could block the flow of oxygen.</p>
<p>A flow rate of 0.5-1 litres/min will deliver 30-35% oxygen 
concentration in the inspired air</p>
<p>Aim for oxygen saturations >92%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="../assets/images/coin68.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin68.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Nasal tube or catheter:</b> Use 8 French size catheter. 
Determine the distance the tube should be passed by 
measuring the distance from the side of the nostril to 
the inner margin of the eyebrow.</p>
<p>Gently insert the catheter into the nostril. A flow rate of 
0.5-1 litres/min in infants will deliver 30-35% oxygen.</p>
<p>Aim for oxygen saturations >90%.</p>
</li></ul>
<a href="../assets/images/coin69.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin69.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<ul><li>
<p>A simple <b>face mask</b> will deliver 40-60% oxygen in an 
emergency and if the infant is very distressed.</p>
<p>A minimum of 4 litres of oxygen per minute is needed 
to prevent rebreathing of expired air.</p>
<p>A face mask with a reservoir attached will deliver 
100% oxygen. It may be used for resuscitation.</p>
<p>The problem with this method is that it may require 
one concentrator per NYI, which may be 
challenging if several NYIs require oxygen at the 
same time.</p>
<p>Aim for oxygen saturations >90%.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>E 6 Oxygen Therapy</h2>

<p><b>Oxygen sources may be used to provide supplemental oxygen directly to patients, 
shared between patients by using a <a class="seealso" href="E5_Oxygen splitter.html">flow splitter</a> 
or used with other treatment 
devices such as <a class="seealso" href="C7_CPAP.html">continous positive airway pressure</a> devices.</b></p>

<p>Supplemental oxygen is indicated for sick children, especially those with hypoxia. Hypoxia 
is defined as an oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt; 90%.
See <a class="seealso" href="E6_Oxygen therapy.html">oxygen therapy</a> for more information.
