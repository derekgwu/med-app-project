<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>
<p><b>Obstruction of the nostrils, mouth or upper airway with secretions or blood will cause 
respiratory compromise and potential hypoxia.</b></p>

<p>Suction pumps can be used in patients to clear secretions, vomitus, and blood from the 
mouth, nostrils, or upper airway.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background"> LABOUR & OBSTETRIC NOTE</h3>

<p>If meconium stained liquor is present at delivery and the baby is not vigorous or has not 
taken a breath, inspect the nose and mouth for obstruction. If meconium is present, gentle 
suctioning is recommended<sup>1</sup>. Routine suctioning is not recommended.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>
<h3>Suction Pumps</h3>
<p><b>A suction pump <b>(2.1) </b>uses a negative vacuum created by an internal pump to remove 
blood or secretions from oral and nasopharyngeal cavities.</b></p>
 <img src="../assets/images/coin8b.png" />

<p>A bacterial filter is used in circuit with the suction pump to filter out any aerosolised particles 
or bacteria from the blood and secretions suctioned from a patient.</p> 


<p>A suction pump may be tailored to adults <b>(2.2)</b> or paediatric <b>(2.3) </b>patients. </p>

<img src="../assets/images/coin9b.png" />

<img src="../assets/images/coin9c.png" />

<p>Although an adult suction pump can be used on paediatric or neonatal patients, the vacuum range is much 
higher which makes it more difficult to control for the low ranges required for neonatal 
patients.<b> Use of an adult pump to treat neonatal patients is not encouraged.</b></p>


<h3>Penguin suckers</h3>
<p>Penguin suckers are reusable devices made of a flexible silicone, which can be used to 
provide low pressure suctioning.<b>(2.4) </b> <b> Penguin suckers are autoclavable. </b>Although suction 
bulbs may also be used, they are not autoclavable, sare difficult to clean, and are not 
recommended due to greater infection risk between patients.</p>

 <img src="../assets/images/coin10 b.png" />
  <img src="../assets/images/coin10c.png" />

<p>Neonatal patients should be suctioned gently, no deeper than the eye can see and only 
within a range of 60 to 100 mmHg of negative pressure and for a period less than 10 
seconds. <b>(Alert 2.1)</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">PREPARING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Collect: <strong>(3.1)</strong></li>
<ul>
<li> Suction pump with collection reservoir</li>
<li>Suction pump filter (if not already attached to pump)</li>
<li>Short suction tubing</li>
<li>Long suction tubing</li>
<li>Suction catheter or Yankauer sucker</li> 
<li>Water in a suitable container (e.g., kidney dish, bowl)</li>
</ul>
<li>Always explain the purpose, risks, and benefits of a procedure to guardians BEFORE 
performing the procedure. Follow handwashing protocol and put on gloves.
<li>Suctioning is only required when there is airway obstruction. Visually inspect the patient’s 
oral and nasopharyngeal cavities for secretions or blood. 
<li>Assess whether to use a suction catheter or Yankauer sucker.
<ul>
<li>For thicker secretions it may be necessary to use a Yankauer sucker but do not 
use in the nares of a newborn.
<li>For thinner secretions, use an appropriately sized suction catheter (typically Fr 
sizes 6, 8 or 10). A correctly sized suction catheter should be the approximate size 
of the nostril. Nasogastric tubes are not recommended as a substitute for a suction 
catheter.
</ul>
<li> If secretions, blood, or meconium are visible, collect:
<ul>
<li> Clean suction catheter or Yankauer sucker
<li> Tape 
</ul>
<li> If using a suction catheter: determine suction depth by measuring from the nose to the ear 
and halfway back. Mark this distance with a small piece of tape.<strong> (3.8)</strong></li>
<li> If using a Yankauer sucker, no measurement is required.<strong> Suctioning should only be 
conducted as far as can be visually assessed.</strong></li>
<li>Place the infant in a neutral position to ensure effective suctioning. <strong>(3.9)</strong></li>

<h3 class="lb_background">STARTING A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li>Collect:<strong> (3.1)</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Suction catheter marked with appropriate suction depth or Yankauer sucker</li>
<li>Suction pump with collection reservoir and tubing in place</li>
<li>Water in a container</li>
</ul>

<li> Always explain the purpose, risks, and benefits of a procedure to guardians BEFORE 
performing the procedure.</li> 
<li>Follow handwashing protocol.</li>
<li>Plug suction machine into power outlet and turn on.</li>
<li>Connect suction catheter marked with appropriate suction depth or Yankauer sucker to 
long suction tubing. <strong>(3.11)</strong></li>
<li>Using the suction regulator, adjust the suction vacuum to the desired level, maintaining 
safe vacuum levels for neonates. Test the suction functionality by suctioning the water.
<li><strong>When using a suction catheter:</strong> pinch the catheter and insert gently into the patient’s 
mouth or nostril to the point marked by the tape. When introducing catheter into the nose 
do so following the floor of the nose. Release the pinch on the catheter slowly as you 
withdraw the catheter from the mouth or nostril, gently rotating until it is completely 
removed. <strong>(3.12)</strong></li>
<li>If using a Yankauer sucker: <strong>for thicker secretions or meconium, it may be necessary 
to use a Yankauer sucker.</strong></li> 

<ul>

<li> Suctioning should only be conducted as far as can be visually assessed when 
using a Yankauer sucker. If secretions are thick, application of 1-2 drops of normal 
saline to both nostrils may assist suctioning and reduce nasal trauma.</li>
<li>Some Yankauer suckers may require a hole at the hub of the sucker to be occluded 
for suctioning pressure.</li>
</ul>

<li> Allow the patient to visibly recover from the procedure. While waiting, rinse the catheter 
with water. Repeat this process on the other side of the mouth or nostril.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5 through 7 until all secretions are removed. <strong>Remember: suctioning 
should be a gentle procedure. Do not suction too vigorously and do not suction too 
long.</strong> Suction only until the reservoir is ¾ full; if it reaches this point, remove collection jar, 
dispose of contents and reattach to complete suctioning.</li>
</ol>

<a href="../assets/images/coin16b.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin16b.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h3 class="lb_background">CARING FOR A PATIENT</h3>


<p>Observe suctioned contents carefully whilst suctioning procedure is taking place:</p>

<ul>
 <li>If fresh blood starts to be suctioned, trauma may have been caused to the oral or 
nasopharyngeal cavities. Decrease the force with which the suction catheter is being 
inserted into the patient’s nose or mouth. </li>
<li>If stomach contents are being suctioned, the patient’s suction catheter is being inserted 
into the oesophagus. Recheck the suction depth measurement.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="lb_background">REMOVING A PATIENT</h3>

<p>Gently withdraw the suction catheter from the patient’s passageway.</p>


<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>


<p><strong>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospitalacquired infections in newborn care units. If devices & equipment are not 
disinfected promptly & adequately between patients, they pose a significant 
infection risk.</strong></p>


<h3 class="lb_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li>Clean hands with soap and water or alcohol before and after initiating treatment 
using a suction pump or handling any tubing that will be used on a patient. </li>
<li>Ensure that all patient-related tubing and consumables (including suction catheters 
and collection reservoirs) are new or have been cleaned thoroughly before use (if 
following re-use guidelines). Any patient-related tubing must be cleaned (following 
the ward protocol) before it is used to suction another patient. Tubing should be 
hung to dry after disinfection and should not touch the floor or other unsanitary 
surfaces whilst drying. </li>
<li> When re-using suction tubing there is a risk of infection if inadequately cleaned. If 
the machine is not cleaned after each use, it can become a source of infection for 
patients in the ward. Suction catheters should never be reused.</li>
<li> All patient-related consumables should be stored in a clean, dry location. Tubing 
should be stored in loose rolls, preventing sharp bends and kinks, which will 
decrease its lifetime.</li>

<h3 class="lb_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Gently disconnect the suction catheter from the suction tubing and dispose of 
catheter appropriately. If reusing, immediately begin hospital protocol for 
disinfection of tubing. Delay in initiating cleaning of reused medical devices 
can lead to the need for more intensive cleaning procedures to remove 
pathogens. If not reusing, discard safely.</li>
<li>Turn off and unplug the suction pump, if not using with another patient. Check filter. 
If filter is obviously dirty, replace. (4.1) Refer to user manual for specific instructions 
on when to change the filter.</li>
<li> Disinfect the suction pump pressure gauge controls using gauze and 70% alcohol.</li>
<li> The housing of the suction pump should be cleaned according to ward guidelines 
for disinfecting surfaces.</li>
<li> All tubing and collection reservoir should be cleaned after each patient.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Remove the collection reservoir from suction pump. (4.2) Dispose of contents and 
disinfect reservoir appropriately, wearing gloves, a mask and apron to ensure staff 
safety. Return collection reservoir to suction pump and store in secure location until 
next use.</li> 
<li> Remove short and long suction tubing pieces. Follow hospital protocol for disinfection 
of tubing.</li>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>


<p>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.<p>

<h3 class="lb_background">CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<p>
<ul><li><strong>Hypoxia: </strong>if a patient is on oxygen, it may be necessary to remove oxygen treatment during 
suctioning, especially when suctioning the oropharynx. This interruption in treatment may worsen 
patient’s hypoxia. Place the patient back on oxygen as soon as oral and nasopharyngeal cavities 
are clear.</li>
<li><strong>Trauma: </strong>incorrect or excessive suctioning of the nose and mouth may cause trauma to mucosal 
surfaces. (This is more likely to happen when the pressures on the machine is above the safety 
range for neonates 60-100mmHg.) If bleeding occurs, stop suctioning, assess severity, and 
restart when safe.</li>
<li><strong>Vomiting: </strong>incorrect measurement of the suction catheter or suctioning too far may stimulate the 
gag reflex and induce vomiting. This also risks potential aspiration. </li>
<li><strong>Vagal stimulation: </strong>inappropriately deep suctioning can cause vagal stimulation resulting in 
apnoea or bradycardia.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<p><strong>Positioning:</strong>suction pumps are not heavy devices but are frequently positioned on walls / 
shelves. This is appropriate if well secured during use. If improperly secured, suction pumps may 
fall, causing potential permanent or fatal injury, particularly to neonatal patients.</p>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>Suction pumps may be powered by mains or battery power <strong> (6.1) </strong>or manually via a foot or 
hand pump. <strong>(6.2) </strong>If a suction pump is battery powered, it should be taken off its charger 
<strong>only as necessary </strong>to ensure that it is charged for use in the event of a power blackout.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin19c.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin19c.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin19d.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin19d.png" max-width="50%"/></a>


<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>Suction pumps should be secured in an accessible location where nursing staff can 
regulate and view vacuum easily, but where the pump is not at risk of falling. Suction 
consumables should be kept nearby for easy access in case of emergency.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>The suction pump should be turned on and allowed to run for 15 minutes every week.</p> 


<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Repair</h2>

<p><strong>Although users are not responsible for repairing their devices, there are steps that 
may be taken to troubleshoot first-line errors that may occur before contacting 
maintenance or engineering support.</strong></p>
