<h2 <h3 style ="color:blue;" id="feeding">Feeding</h2>

<p>Exclusive <a class="seealso" href="C2_Routine Care.html#Breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a>
is recommended in the majority of cases as it provides the best fluids, 
nutrition, and protection from disease whilst promoting growth and development. Term infants 
that are well should be breastfed on demand. If this is not possible e.g., mother or infant is sick, 
then expressed breast milk should be given. Maintenance fluid is the amount of fluid required to 
replace losses and is calculated on the age and weight of the infant.</p>

<p>During the first few days of life, feeds are given in small amount and gradually increased.</p>

<p>Feeds are given every two or every three hours by naso/oro-gastric tube or cup feeding depending 
upon the maturity of the baby.

<h3 id="maintenanceiv">Which fluid?</h3>

<p>Maintenance fluid is the amount of fluid required to replace losses and is calculated based on the 
age and weight of the infant. However, IV fluids can run too fast or deliver too much fluid quickly 
and overhydrate a NYI and needs close monitoring.</p>

<p>Generally, we do not exceed 100 ml/kg per day when administering maintenance fluids by the IV 
route to NYI.</p>

<p> See <a class="seealso" href="WC_Maintenance Oral and IV fluids.html#fluids">wall charts 
</a>for the volume of fluids per hour based on the child’s weight and age.</p>

1 ml of fluid = 15 drops (for giving blood) <br/>

<h3 id="monitor">Monitor the IV infusion very carefully</b> (ideally through an in-line burette or syringe pump):</h3>

 <ul>
<li> Use a monitoring sheet.</li>
<li> Calculate the drip rate.</li>
<li> Check the drip rate and volume infused every hour.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Monitor the NYI clinical status:</b></p>

<ul>
<li> Heart rate, pulse volume, respiratory rate and skin perfusion.</li>
<li> Check for oedema/puffiness of eyes (may indicate volume overload).</li>
<li> Weigh baby daily to detect excessive weight gain (excess fluid) or loss (insufficient fluid); 
adjust IVfluids appropriately.</li>
<li> Check how frequently urine is passed.</li>
<li> Each time you see the patient, assess the drip site for swelling of the site in case the 
cannula has tissued.</li>
</ul>

<p>Weight and urine output are the best overall clinical guides to assessing the adequacy of therapy. 
Introduce milk feeding by oro-gastric tube or breastfeeding as soon as it is safe to do so. Oral feeds 
are slowly increased while IV fluids are gradually withdrawn. The oral intake must be taken into 
account when calculating the IV rates. Reduce the IV fluid rates as the volume of milk feeds increases 
in infants on oro-gastric feeds. Discontinue IV fluids once oral intake reaches 2/3rd total requirements.</p>
