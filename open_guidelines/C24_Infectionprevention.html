<h2> Introduction</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of essential devices to newborn care units is critical to improving 
newborn survival. However, devices can increase hospital acquired infections 
if adequate disinfection and cleaning measures are not put into place.</b></p>


<p>This module focuses on infection control measures associated specifically with the 
essential devices, staff and visitors. A comprehensive discussion of infection 
prevention and control measures for a newborn care unit is beyond the scope of this 
document. Please refer to local and WHO guidelines for more detailed practice 
guidance.</p>

<h2> Ward Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Hospitals, wards, equipment and staff are all sources of infection for a baby. 
These infections are called Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI).</b></p>

<p>HAIs are often caused by bacteria that are resistant to commonly available antibiotics 
- multidrug resistant bacteria - and are difficult to treat or eradicate from the nursery. 
Meticulous care is required to prevent infections from spreading from one baby to 
another in the ward. The prevention and control of all infections include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Hand hygiene</li>
<li> Environmental cleanliness</li>
<li> Medical equipment maintenance and cleaning</li>
<li> Waste disposal </li>
</ul>

<p>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene<b> (WASH)</b> are key elements in preventing and controlling 
infections.<sup>1</sup></p>


<p>Infections are a major cause of morbidity and increased mortality. They often result in 
prolonged hospital stays and increased costs to the family. Sick and small neonates 
are at higher risk than other patients of acquiring HAIs due to the number of devices 
they may come into contact with in neonatal units. Lowering rates of HAIs means less use of antibiotics and ultimately fewer infections with multidrug resistant bacteria which 
are very difficult to treat in newborns. </p>

<p>While there are a number of critical elements associated with infection prevention and 
control in newborn units that will be discussed here, the<b> two most important </b>forms of 
infection control are always <b>hand washing</b> and <b>health screening.</b></p>

<h3 id="hand"  div style="background-color:red">HANDWASHING</h3>

<p>Hand hygiene is the <b>single most important </b>measure to reduce transmitting infections 
between people and from one site to another on the same patient. All guardians, health 
care workers (HCWs), or visitors should be taught thorough handwashing (using the 
WHO technique).</p>

<ul>
<li> When entering a unit all HCWs and guardians must thoroughly wash their hands and 
arms up to the elbow with soap and water. Hands should be air-dried or dried using 
single-use towels that are then washed, dried and ironed before reuse. </li>
<li> Hands should be washed whenever visibly soiled. Otherwise alcohol-based hand 
sanitiser is acceptable.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hand washing or sanitising should be the <b>last</b> thing you do before touching a patient 
and the <b>first</b> thing you do after completing tasks on a patient</p>

<h3  div style="background-color:grey">GLOVES</h3>

<p>Gloves are worn to protect <b>both </b>HCWs and patients by reducing the spread of 
infection from bacteria on the hands. Gloves <b>do not</b> change the need to wash or 
sanitise one’s hands between patient interactions. Gloves should be worn <b>only when 
necessary and disposed of immediately after use, such as when:</b>

<ul>
<li> Touching bodily fluids, non-intact skin, and mucous membranes.</li>
<li> Performing invasive procedures.</li>
<li> Touching contaminated objects or surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Repeat hand washing</b> or sanitising promptly after removing gloves.</p>

<small>Zoom in for details. </small>
<h3 div style="background-color:grey">DRESS CODE</h3>

<p>All hospital staff (including HCWs, maintenance and cleaning staff) should wear clean 
clothes with bare arms below the elbow when entering the neonatal ward. Department 
policy should be followed; this usually includes that no jewellery (apart from plain 
wedding bands) is worn, and that nails are kept short, natural, and unvarnished.</p>

<p>Gowns are not a standard precaution for HCWs or families in most neonatal units; if 
gowns are used, they should not be shared or reused until re-washed.</p>

<h3 div style="background-color:grey">HEALTH SCREENING</h3>

<p>Any HCW or guardian with an acute or transmissible infection should not be on the 
ward to minimise the spread of infection. Mothers or guardians who have an acute 
illness should be isolated with their infants, if possible. Any guardian who has an acute 
respiratory illness should wear a mask and be especially careful about hand washing.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<h3 id="isolation"  div style="background-color:grey">PATIENT ISOLATION</h3>

<p>Departmental isolation policies should cohort at-risk patients with similar infections in 
an isolation area within the nursery (e.g., babies with multi-drug resistant infections, 
highly contagious infections, babies born before arrival with signs of infection or any 
patients with airborne infections). Strict hand hygiene measures should be followed on 
entry and exit from this area. If equipment is used in any areas where patients are 
isolated, it should not be returned to the main neonatal care ward until it has been 
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected according to ward protocol.</p>

<p>Patients should not share cots or radiant warmers. If circumstances mandate that 
such a practice is unavoidable, cohorting patients with similar illnesses is preferred.</p>

<h3  div style="background-color:grey">EQUIPMENT CLEANING</h3>

<p>All neonatal medical equipment (suctions, CPAP, vital sign monitors, radiant warmers, 
etc.) should be cleaned regularly in accordance with the training modules and 
equipment manuals. WHO recommends 0.5% dilution of chlorine as the standard 
disinfectant for materials and surfaces contaminated by blood or body fluids.2 For 
metal and rubber surfaces which may be corroded by chlorine, 70% alcohol is also 
commonly utilised for low level disinfection. <b>Table 3.1</b> below provides more information 
on low-level disinfectants appropriate for neonatal wards.3 Cleaning should be carried 
out when the equipment power source is switched off and it is unplugged. Care must 
be taken not to let water or other liquid enter internal to a device. Diluted disinfectants 
have various lifespans; ward guidelines should include accurate lifespans and dilution 
schedules for those in standard of practice.</p>

<h3 div style="background-color:grey">ROUTINE CLEANING</h3>

<p>All horizontal surfaces, including bedside equipment (bed rails, bedside tables, 
trolleys, commodes, taps, weighing scales, etc.) are cleaned and disinfected with a 
hospital-approved detergent OR disinfectant such as 0.5% chlorine or 70% alcohol 
solution <b>at least daily </b>and whenever visibly soiled. </p>

<p>Between patient admissions, all cots and patient beds should be cleaned thoroughly 
(including all surfaces of incubators) with a hospital-approved detergent/disinfectant 
such as 0.5% chlorine or 70% alcohol solution.</p>

<p>Floors, surfaces, and handles in the neonatal unit should be cleaned daily with 
appropriate solutions and according to departmental policy.</p>


<h3 div style="background-color:grey">SAFE HANDLING OF SHARPS</h3>

<p>To prevent injuries, use extreme caution when handling sharps. This is particularly 
pertinent whilst drawing blood during glucometer reading.</p>

<ul>
<li> DO NOT RECAP used needles.</li> 
<li> Do not remove used needles from disposable syringes by hand.</li>
<li> Do not bend or break used needles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Place disposable syringes, lancets, needles, and other sharp items promptly in 
appropriate puncture-resistant containers.</p>

<h2 id="reprocessing"> Reprocessing Single-Use Devices</h2>

<p><b>In general, all single use devices should be used as such. However, in resource 
limited settings consumables meant for one-time use are commonly reused due 
to cost and supply chain limitations.</b></p>

<p>Departmental policy for disinfecting and reprocessing single-use-devices must always 
be strictly followed in order to prevent infection spreading between patients.</p>


<p>When reprocessing single-use devices, it is extremely important that the cleaning 
process is not delayed following completion of use. There should be a detailed 
standard of practice as well as oversight processes for ensuring timely and high-quality 
reprocessing. If equipment is not reprocessed promptly or adequately between 
patients, it poses a significant infection risk. Please refer to the <b>Reference Manual for 
Health Care Facilities with Limited Resources Infection Prevention and Control, 
Module 6<sup>3</sup></b>
for more detailed guidance on reprocessing of single-use devices.</p>

<p>Respiratory circuits, tubing and equipment are the most commonly reprocessed 
single-use devices. <b>Syringes, needles, and disposable gloves must never be 
reprocessed.</b></p>
