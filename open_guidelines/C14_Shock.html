<h2 style ="color:blue;" id="intro">Introduction </h2>
<p>The letters <b>C</b> in <q>ABCCCD</q> stand for <b>Circulation, Coma and 
Convulsions.</b>
This module will help with the systematic assessment, resuscitation and treatment of all NYI 
with life-threatening conditions that are most frequently seen in infants less than 2 months of age.</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<p>Shock, also called ‘severe impaired circulation’, can be defined as the life-threatening failure of 
adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues and may be due to decreased blood perfusion of tissues, 
inadequate blood oxygen saturation, or increased oxygen demand from the tissues that results in 
decreased end-organ oxygenation and dysfunction. If left untreated, shock results in sustained 
multiple organ dysfunction, end-organ damage and possible death. </p>

<h2 style ="color:blue;" id="assess">Assessment</h2>

<p>All sick infants are assessed for <b>A</b>irway, <b>B</b>reathing, <b>C</b>irculation, <b>C</b>oma, <b>C</b>onvulsions and severe 
<b>D</b>ehydration <b>(ABCCCD).</b> In view of the poor outcome in many small infants due to co-existent 
hypothermia and hypoglycaemia, the management of these is detailed here with ABCCCD. Efforts 
should be made to maintain normal blood glucose and a normal body temperature while 
managing ABCCCD.</p>

<p><b>Assess Circulation for Signs of Shock</b></p>


<p>After the airway and breathing has been assessed, check circulation: Rapid assessment of 
circulation.</p>

<ul>
<li> Is the baby alert?</li>
<li> Are the hands cold?</li>
<li> Is there a temperature gradient up the limbs?</li>
<li> Is the capillary refill time <a href="#crt">(CRT)</a> > 3 seconds?</li>
<li> Is the <a href="#pulse">pulse</a> fast and weak?</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the signs listed above is a sign of impaired (poor) circulation. 
Severely impaired circulation (shock) is present when 3 of the signs are present</p>

<p>Also important to recognise so that appropriate treatment is given:</p>

<ul>
<li> Are there signs of <a class="seealso" href="C18_Diarrhoea.html">dehydration</a>
- sunken eyes/decreased skin turgor?</li>
<li> Is the baby pale?</li>
<li> Has the baby got severe wasting/oedema?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Also assess oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure.</b></p>

<p><b>Is the Capillary Refill Time (<a id="crt">CRT</a>) longer than 3 seconds? </b></p>

<p>Capillary refill is a simple test that assesses how quickly blood returns to the skin after pressure 
is applied. It is carried out by applying finger pressure to the centre of the chest over the sternum 
for 3 seconds. The capillary refill time is the time from release of pressure to complete return of 
the pink colour. It should be less than 3 seconds. If it is more than 3 seconds the child may be in 
shock. This sign is reliable except when the room temperature is low, as a cold environment can 
cause a delayed capillary refill. In such a situation check the pulses and decide about shock.</p>

<p><b>Is the <a id="pulse">pulse</a> weak and fast?</b></p>

<p>Evaluation of pulses is critical to the assessment of systemic perfusion. The radial pulse should 
be felt. If it is strong and not obviously fast (rate greater than 160 bpm in an infant), the pulse is 
adequate; no further assessment is needed. In an infant if the radial pulse cannot be felt, palpate 
for the femoral pulse, if a baby has a weak radial or femoral pulse, it is a worrying sign. Assess 
hydration status.</p>

<p>Treatment of shock requires teamwork. The following actions need to be started simultaneously. <br/>
