<h2>Why is care of the normal term infant so important?</h2>
<p><b>The vast majority of newborns require no intervention at birth other than routine normal 
care.</b> If this is done well, it vastly reduces the likelihood of problems. Most newborns should be 
transferred to the post-natal wards for rooming-in with their mothers. These babies still need to 
be monitored because they are at continued risk of 
<a class="seealso" href="C10_Hypothermia.html">hypothermia</a> and feeding difficulties during 
the first few days of life. These babies can also become sick and develop danger signs. The 
mother needs counselling and appropriate treatment when required. Babies born in health 
facilities should not be sent home in the crucial first 48 hours of life. Follow-up care should be 
organised before the mothers are <a href="#discharge">discharged</a> (also see
<a class="seealso" href="C20_Discharge.html">the chapter on discharge from the hospital</a>. Take time to counsel her and involve another 
guardian, where possible. Ensure that they understand the implications of leaving early, advise 
them on <a href="#Danger">danger signs</a>, and arrange a follow-up plan for the baby.</p>
<p>A post-natal room should be kept warm with no draughts from open doors or windows. A room 
temperature of at least 25<sup>o</sup>C is required to help keep the baby warm. A mother and her baby 
should be kept together from birth if possible. This helps the mother form an early, close-loving 
relationship (bonding) with her baby. She can also respond quickly when her baby wants to feed, 
which helps establish <a href="#Breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> and reduces breastfeeding 
difficulties (<a class="seealso" href="bibl.html">1</a>).</p>

<h2 id="routine" style="color:blue;">Daily Routine Care of the Newborn</h2>

<ol>
<li> <b>Review labour and birth record </b></li>
 <p>Review the labour and birth record to identify risk factors or any events during the birth that
may be important in the management of the mother and the baby.</p>

<li><b> Ask the mother:</b></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>"Is the baby sucking well?"</b> 
Health care professionals should discuss a mother’s progress with <a href="#Breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> within 
the first two days after delivery to assess if she is on course to breastfeeding effectively.</li>
<li> <b>"Has the baby passed stools?"</b>
Term babies should pass meconium by 24 hours of birth. Passage after 24 hours is NOT 
NORMAL and needs evaluation by a clinician.</li>
<li> <b>“Has the baby passed urine?”</b>
Urine should be passed by 48 hours. It is NOT NORMAL if no urine is passed by 48 hours.</li>
<li> <b>“Is the baby jaundiced (yellow)?”</b>
Babies who develop <a class="seealso" href="C13_Jaundice.html">jaundice</a> within the first 24 hours after birth should be evaluated, as 
this is NOT NORMAL.</li>

<h2 id="Breastfeeding" style="color:blue;">Breastfeeding</h2>
<p> <b>Benefits of Breastfeeding</b> <br />
Babies who are exclusively breastfed for six months will get the greatest health benefits and 
disease prevention. </p>
<p>Colostrum (first yellowish milk after delivery) – this will meet the needs of the baby in the first few 
days after birth.</p>
<p></p>Discomfort for the mother at the start of breastfeeds in the first few days is not uncommon, but 
this should not persist.</p>
Benefits of breastfeeding to the mother include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Decreased risk of breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers.</li>
<li> Natural contraceptive method in the first six months of breastfeeding (LAM).</li>
<li> Helps to prevent postpartum haemorrhage.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>A baby may have a variable feeding pattern, at least over the first few days, as the baby takes 
small amounts of colostrum and then takes increasingly larger feeds, as mother’s milk supply 
comes in. When the milk supply is established, a baby will generally feed every 2–3 hours, but this
will vary between babies and, if the baby is healthy, his/her individual pattern should be respected.
Empty both breasts at each feed.</p>
     

<h3>Assess Breastfeeding <br /></h3>
<p>Ask mother if the infant has breastfed in the previous hour.<br />
If infant has not fed in the previous hour, ask why so that you can understand if there are any 
challenges or misunderstandings. Regardless of the reasons given, ask the mother to put her 
infant to the breast and assess for the following:</p>

<ol>
   <li>First assess the <b><a href="#Position">position</a>.</b></li>
   <li>Then assess the <b><a href="#Attachment">attachment</a>.</b></li>
   <li>Then assess the <b><a href="#Sucking">sucking</a>.</b></li>
</ol>

<b id="Position">1. Position</b>
   <p>Observe the breastfeed. Signs of good positioning:</p>

<ul>
<li>Baby’s body is well supported.</li>
<li>The head, neck, and the body of the baby are kept in the same plane.</li>
<li>Entire body of the baby faces the mother. Baby’s abdomen touches mother’s 
abdomen.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<b id="Attachment">2. Attachment</b>
 <p>Signs of <b>good attachment</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chin touching breast, mouth wide open.</li>
<li>Lower lip turned outward.</li>
<li>More areola above than below the mouth.</li>
</ul>
<a href="../assets/images/coin2.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin2.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p><b>Bad attachment:</b></p>
<a href="../assets/images/coin2a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin2a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>


<p>Poor attachment results in painful nipples → breast milk is not removed effectively thus 
causing breast engorgement → poor milk supply, hence baby is not satisfied and irritable 
→ breast produces less milk, resulting in a frustrated baby who refuses to suck → poor 
weight gain.</p>
<b id="Sucking">3. Sucking</b>
</ol>
<p>Effective sucking occurs when the infant makes slow deep sucks, sometimes pausing. 
If not sucking well, then look for ulcers or white patches in the mouth (oral thrush).</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="yellowframe" colspan="2"style="color:blue;"><b>Key Facts for Providers and Mothers/Guardians:<br/> Breastfeeding</b></td></tr>
 <tr>
 <td class="yellowframe"><p>If breastfeeding is not progressing, support and assistance with <a href="#Position">positioning</a> 
and <a href="#Attachment">attachment</a> on the breast should be provided.</p>
<p>If nipple pain persists after repositioning, consider evaluation for thrush or
cracks.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of engorgement are present, the mother should be 
encouraged to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wear a well-fitting bra or binder.</li>
    <li>Feed frequently, including prolonged breastfeeding from the affected breast.</li>
    <li>Massage breasts and if necessary, hand express milk.</li>
    <li>Take analgesia, if necessary.</li></ul>
    <p>If signs and symptoms of mastitis are present (red, tender, hot segment or 
whole breast, mother may be febrile), a woman should be advised to do the 
following:</p>
<ul><li>Continue breastfeeding and/or hand expression to ensure effective milk removal.</li>
     <li>Gently massage the breast to relieve any blockage.</li>
     <li> Seek assistance with positioning and attachment.</li>
     <li>Take analgesia compatible with breastfeeding, for example paracetamol.</li>
     <li> Increase mother’s fluid intake.</li>
</ul>
     </td>
     </tr>
     </table>

<p>If signs and symptoms of mastitis persist more than several hours, the mother should contact her 
healthcare provider and may require antibiotic treatment. If the baby is not taking sufficient milk 
directly from the breast and supplementary feeds are necessary, expressed breast milk should 
be given by a cup or spoon; supplementation is not recommended.</p>

<h2 id="Common Infections" style="color:blue;">Common Congenital Infections</h2>
<h3><b id="HIV">HIV</b></h3>

<p>All babies born to HIV positive mothers should be managed according to the current Malawi 
Integrated Guidelines for providing HIV services in Children and Adults (<a class="seealso" href="bibl.html">2</a>). The lactating mother 
should be treated with antiretroviral (ARV) medication.</p>
<p> <a href="#Nevirapine">Nevirapine</a> <a class="seealso" href="Formulary.html#nevirapine">syrup</a> is given to all HIV exposed babies as soon as possible after birth until six weeks

until they are confirmed to be HIV negative, at least six weeks after breastfeeding has 
stopped.</li>
 </ul> 


<h3><b id="Syphilis">Syphilis</b></h3>
<p>Test the mother for syphilis if she was not been tested in the last three months. Treat all infants 
of mothers who are VDRL seropositive and are untreated or inadequately treated or if there is no 
clear documentation of full treatment. Check if the partner was treated as well. If unsure, it is safer 
to treat. Please note that there may be no clinical signs of infection or a variable number of signs.</p>

closely for symptoms and signs of disease. If the baby is well, commence 
<a class="seealso" href="Formulary.html#isoniazid">isoniazid (H)</a>  prophylaxis 
at 10 mg/kg/day and do not give BCG vaccine.</p>
<p>Re-evaluate the infant at the age of six weeks, noting weight gain, and taking an X-ray of the 
chest, if possible. If the infant is doing well and tests are negative, continue prophylactic <a href="#isoniazid">isoniazid</a> 
to complete six months of treatment.</p>
<p>If any findings suggest active disease, start full anti-TB treatment, according to national 
guidelines.</p>

<ul>
   <li>Continue to <a href="#Breastfeeding">breastfeed</a> as normal.</li>

<p>If the baby is not well at birth and has signs/symptoms suggestive of TB disease, collect gastric 
aspirates first thing in the morning using a nasogastric tube. Send for Gene X-pert and culture 
where possible, and commence full TB treatment according to national guidelines. Be aware that 
the absence of TB in gastric aspirate does not exclude TB and the whole clinical picture must be 
taken into account.</p>


<h2 id="Discharge" style="color:blue;">Discharge and Providing Follow-Up Care</h2>

<p>Correct planning of discharge from the hospital is very important for the newborn.</p>
<p>Infants who are discharged from the hospital should return for follow-up care to the nearest health 
facility at one week and six weeks. If any danger sign is present, the baby should be brought to 
the clinic immediately. Communicate with the health personnel who will be responsible for follo-up care by writing in the health passport.</p>
