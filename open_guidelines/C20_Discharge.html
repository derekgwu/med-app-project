<h1 align="center" style="color:blue;">Discharge from the Hospital
(Chapter 20)</h1> 

<hr class="yellowline" />

<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<p><em>After completion of this chapter the participant should be able to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li> Describe the <a href="#indications">indications</a> for the discharge of a NYI from hospital.</li>
<li> Describe the elements of the discharge of a NYI from hospital.</li>
<li> List discharge <a href="#planning">planning advice</a> for family.</li>
</ul>
 <hr class="yellowline" />

<p>Planning of discharge from the hospital is as important as diagnosis and treatment. The NYI 
has to remain in hospital while receiving oxygen for respiratory instability, IV treatment, if 
feeding has not been established, or body temperature cannot be maintained.</p>

<h2 id="indications">Indications for Discharge</h2>

<ul>
<li> Patient stable and has improved.</li> 
<li> Baby gaining weight for three (3) consecutive days.</li>
<li> Established lactation in a mother.</li>
<li> Ability to breastfeed or cup feed satisfactorily.</li>
</ul>

ophthalmology and surgical).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="planning">Providing Follow-Up Care</h3>
<ul>
<li> Infants who are discharged from the hospital should return for follow-up in relation to the
present problem as needed.</li>
<li> Plan the routine follow-up with their local provider depending on the weight, age, and HIV 
exposure status of the NYI – write clearly the purpose of the follow-up, 
e.g., to do HIV DNA PCR.</li>
<li> Discuss where and when the NYI will receive their next scheduled immunisation.</li>
<li> Discuss where the mother will access care if the NYI has a 
<a class="seealso" href="C2_Routine Care.html#Danger">danger sign</a>.</li>
</ul>

of delivery, APGAR scores, date of admission, date of discharge, diagnosis, most recent 
investigations done, treatment given, ongoing treatment, counselling given and reason for
