<h2 id="Clinical Problem">Clinical Problem</h2>

<p><b>An oxygen concentrator is used on its own when oxygen needs to be delivered to 
one or two patients. Concentrators may also be used to share oxygen between 
multiple patients using a flow splitter or used with other treatment devices such as 
continuous positive airway pressure devices.</b></p>

<p>Supplemental oxygen is indicated for sick children, especially those with hypoxia 
(SpO<sub>2</sub>&lt;90%) which has many clinical causes. Possible causes are outlined
 in <a class="seealso" href="C6_oxygen.html">Oxygen Therapy</a>: Clinical Problem.</strong></p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><b>Oxygen concentrators (2.1) provide a source of oxygen at flows from 2 to 10 litres 
per minute (L/min). Maximum flow delivered per device depends on the model and 
can range from 5, 8 or 10 L/min.</b></p>

<p>Oxygen concentrators are one of the most commonly used sources of oxygen therapy, 
concentrating 85-95.5% oxygen from ambient air using two sieve beds made of a 
substance that captures nitrogen.</p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin38.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin38.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Oxygen concentrators may provide oxygen via two types of flow:</p>

<ul>
<li> Intermittent/pulse flow: provides puffs of oxygen into nasal passageway at typical 
breathing rates.</li>
<li> Continuous: provides constant oxygen delivery at a steady rate.<//li>
</ul>

<p>In intermediate care neonatal units, concentrators with continuous oxygen delivery are 
preferred for most applications. Common components of an oxygen concentrator are 
outlined in <b>2.2.</b></p>

<a href="../assets/images/coin39.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin39.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Neonatal patients should reach SpO<sub>2</sub> levels of 90 – 95% by 15 minutes after birth. <b>(Alert 
2.1)</b> If oxygen is needed it is recommended to give between 0.5-1 L/min.2 Whilst on 
oxygen, regular monitoring should be conducted using a pulse oximeter to ensure that 
this saturation range is maintained for the duration of treatment. Ideally, patients suffering 
from severe respiratory distress should have continuous pulse oximetry monitoring 
throughout care.<sup>2</sup></p>

<td> When  making  this  recommendation  the following  resources were
considered:
<ul>
<li>According to the Textbook of Neonatal Resuscitation (NRP), <br/>
7th Ed., “After birth, the oxygen saturation gradually increases <br/>
above 90%. However, even healthy term newborns may take <br/>
10 minutes or longer to reach this saturation” (p. 77).<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Target peripheral oxygen concentrations (SpO 2) for newborns  <br/>
vary depending on age and clinical condition. However, most <br/>
authorities agree that saturations between 90-95% minimises <br/>
the complications associated with both low and high oxygen <br/>
levels including death, neurodevelopmental impairment and <br/>
Retinopathy of Prematurity.

<h2 id="Management">Management</h2>

<p>Management of an oxygen concentrator covers how to use the device in a variety 
of settings, including set up for a patient, patient preparation & commencement, 
care whilst on the device & removal of the patient from the device.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">SETTING UP FOR A PATIENT</h3>

<ol>
<li> Plug oxygen concentrator’s power cable into the oxygen concentrator <b>(3.1a)</b> & into 
wall and turn on power at socket. Turn on concentrator. <b>(3.1b)</b></li>
<a href="../assets/images/coin42.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin42.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin42a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin42a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li> Set flow to desired rate. If machine has not been turned on, allow to run for 5 
minutes or until indicator light <b>(3.2)</b> shows that concentrator is providing 
appropriate concentrations of oxygen for treatment. Check that no alarms sound 
on the machine.</li>
<li> Assess whether your patient requires humidified flow. If oxygen needs are greater 
than 4 L/min, connect a humidifier.2,11</li>
<li> Connect correctly sized nasal prongs to oxygen port on machine <b>(3.3)</b> or to 
humidifier (if using).</li>

<a href="../assets/images/coin43.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin43.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin43a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin43a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<li>Test that oxygen flow has begun by placing your finger near the nasal prongs, 
ensuring that flow commences. This can also be tested by the submerging the 
nasal prongs in clean water and checking for bubbles (3.4), also known as the 
<q>Bubble Test.</q><sup>11</sup></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Infection prevention">Infection Prevention</h2>

<p><b>Routine and adequate cleaning of medical devices is critical to prevent hospitalacquired infections in newborn care units. If devices and equipment are not 
disinfected or reprocessed promptly or adequately between patients, they may 
pose a significant infection risk.</b></p>

<h3 class="gr_background">GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION</h3>

<ol>
<li> Housing of the oxygen concentrator should be cleaned according to ward 
guidelines for disinfecting surfaces.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="gr_background">DISINFECTION AFTER USE</h3>

<ol>
<li> Turn off and unplug the oxygen concentrator, if not using with another patient. If 
reusing tubing, immediately begin hospital protocol for disinfection as outlined in 
Oxygen Therapy: Infection Prevention.</li>
<li> Disinfect the oxygen flowmeter controls using gauze and 70% alcohol. <b>(4.1)</b></li>
<li> Housing of the oxygen concentrator should be cleaned according to ward 
guidelines for disinfecting surfaces. Flowmeter controls and LEDs should be 
cleaned using 70% alcohol after every use.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Complications">Complications</h2>

<p><b>Introduction of equipment in newborn care units poses clinical and device 
complications for patients. Awareness of potential complications is critical to 
maximise patient safety.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">DEVICE COMPLICATIONS</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>Inadequate oxygen concentrations:</b> If the oxygen concentrator indicates inadequate
concentrations of oxygen <b>(5.1), </b>machine maintenance is needed. Replace the
concentrator if possible; if not available, increase monitoring frequency to ensure clinical
stability until concentrator can be replaced or maintained.</li></ol>

<a href="../assets/images/coin46.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin46.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<h2 id="Maintenance">Care & Maintenance</h2>

<p><b>Users are responsible for basic first-line care and maintenance to ensure 
equipment lasts to their potential lifetime.</b></p>

<h3 class="lb_background">POWER SOURCE</h3>

<p>Oxygen concentrators may be powered via mains or grid power with a voltage protector 
in line, or a rechargeable battery, depending on model. </p>

<h3 class="lb_background">WARD LOCATION</h3>

<p>The concentrator should be located in a clean, dry, well-ventilated space close to any 
oxygen splitters that are in use and in a location that is easily viewed and accessed by 
neonatal staff. The back of the concentrator should be 30 – 35 centimetres away from the 
nearest wall to ensure that airflow can be sucked into the concentrator.</p>

<h3 class="lb_background">USER PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>Oxygen concentrators typically have two filters that should be cleaned as part of 
preventive maintenance:</p>

<ul>
<li> Gross particle filter: this filter is external to the machine and looks like a black or grey
sponge. <b>(6.1)</b> To clean:</li>

<ol>

<li> Pull the gross particle filter gently from the back of the oxygen concentrator. 
Replace with spare filter.</li>
<li> Put the filter in cool, soapy water and swirl gently to remove debris.</li>
<li> Remove from soapy water and place in shaded area until completely dry. Store 
as spare filter until next cleaning is needed.</li>
</ol>
<li> Bacterial filter: this filter is internal to the machine and is made up of either filter papers or
a thick white felt filter. <b>(6.2) Do not wash this filter in water.</b> This filter should be cleaned
by your maintenance department.</li>
</ul>

<a href="../assets/images/coin47.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin47.png" max-width="50%"/></a>
<a href="../assets/images/coin47a.png"><img src="../assets/images/coin47a.png" max-width="50%"/></a>

<p>Bacterial (internal) and gross particle (external) filters should be checked weekly, with 
cleaning provided every 2 weeks or more frequently as needed. <b>Never put a wet filter 
in place on an oxygen concentrator.</b> </p>

<p>The oxygen concentrator should be turned on and allowed to run for at least 15 minutes 
every week if it has not been in use. Sieve beds within concentrators can become contaminated with ambient water molecules if not regularly used; turning on the concentrator will prevent this contamination. </p>

<p>Due to concentrator wear, maximum flow (L/min) while maintaining appropriate oxygen concentration may decrease over time by as much as 3 L/min. If oxygen concentration at maximum flow begins to decrease or the low oxygen concentrator indicator light consistently shows at high flow rates, alert your maintenance department to organise and conduct repairs. All preventive maintenance and cleaning should be recorded in a 
logbook.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting & Repair</h2>

<p><b>Although users are not responsible for repairing their devices, there are steps that may be taken to troubleshoot first-line errors that may occur before contacting maintenance or engineering support. </b></p>
